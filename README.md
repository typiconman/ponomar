IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Ponomar is ALPHA-PHASE software and is intended for SOFTWARE-TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.

In order to fully use the Ponomar Java program, the following steps can be followed:
1) Install the Ponomar Unicode fonts located at https://sci.ponomar.net/fonts.html. 
Although this font is for primarily displaying Church Slavonic, 
it does contain special Typicon glyphs that are used by most of the other languages.
Note that Ponomar uses the TrueType version of this font (Ponomar Unicode TT)
because Java has poor support of OpenType fonts.

2) Install an SDK for Java. 

3) Create the .class files by typing 

`make`

4) From the root of this project, type 

`java Ponomar.Main`

and the main Ponomar interface should appear.

5) A Perl API is available in Ponomar/APIs/Perl. See its documentation.

6) If you make any changes, be sure to run the regression tests:

`make test`

.
