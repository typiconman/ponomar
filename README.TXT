IMPORTANT INFORMATION
Ponomar is ALPHA-PHASE software and is intended for SOFTWARE-TESTING PURPOSES ONLY.

In order to fully use the Ponomar Java programme, the following steps can be followed:
1) Install the Ponomar Unicode font located at http://www.ponomar.net/cu_support/fonts.html. Although this font is for primarily displaying Church Slavonic, it does contain special Typicon glyphs that are used by most of the other languages. Note that Ponomar uses the TrueType version of this font (Ponomar Unicode TT) because Java has poor support of OpenType fonts.
2) Install an SDK for Java. 
3) Create the .class files by typing 

make

4) From the root of this project, type 

java Ponomar.Main

and the main Ponomar interface should appear.

5) Additional Ponomar Project software -- fonts and keyboard drivers for working with Church Slavic texts may be found at http://www.ponomar.net/cu_support.html
