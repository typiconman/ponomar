This folder contains scripts that use the Perl API to either generate the Ponomar data automagically
or to perform regression tests.

NOTE: do NOT run scripts 1 and 2 directly; rather, run `make test` from the root directory.

The following tests are available:
1. paschalion.pl
	This script creates a paschalion table for 532 years (one great cycle) beginning with 1941.
	Output is written to paschalion.txt
	Base specification is in paschalion_baseline.txt

	The purpose of this script is to test if:
		* Unicode support is working normally
		* The API loads properly
		* Support for Julian dates and computations is sane
		* The Paschalion is implemented correctly
	NOTE THAT ALL DATES ARE ACCORDING TO THE JULIAN CALENDAR

2. test_lj.pl
	This script tests the implementation of the Lucan Jump. It runs the Ponomar API for
	a given set of years and checks that the lessons at Liturgy are the same as those
	specified in the data files used by kahuna.pl to generate the rules for the Lucan Jump.

	WARNING: THIS SCRIPT ONLY TESTS IF NO ARBITRARY CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE CMDs IN THE XML FILES.
    IT DOES NOT CHECK IF THE ACTUAL DATA USED TO GENERATE THE CMDs IS SANE.
    IF YOU MODIFY THE DATA AND RUN KAHUNA.PL, THEN RUN THIS SCRIPT, YOU WILL OBVIOUSLY GET THE SAME DATA BACK.

3. kahuna.pl
	* kahuna -- a Hawaiian word, defined as a "magician, wizard, minister, expert in any profession".
	This is a complicated script that generates the Lucan Jump implementation rules on the basis
	of data files. The data files are stored in the data/ folder.
	For an explanation of the Lucan Jump and for the charts that serve as the basis for the data files,
	see the paper: Андреев А. А. О порядке чтения Евангелия за Божественной литургией в свете
		рекомендаций Поместного собора 1917-18 гг. // Вестник Екатеринбургской духовной
		семинарии. 2018.

	YOU SHOULD NOT MODIFY KAHUNA.PL OR THE RELEVANT DATA FILES WITHOUT CONSULTING ALEKSANDR ANDREEV.

4. typicon_menologion.pl
    A DEPRECATED SCRIPT TO USED TO GENERATE MENOLOGION DATA FOR THE ENGLISH TYPICON IN TEX FORMAT

5. create_tables.pl
    A DEPRECATED SCRIPT THAT DOES SOMETHING WITH TABLES?

6. create_index.pl
