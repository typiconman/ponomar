<TEXT Value="We worship Thine immaculate icon, O Good One, asking the forgiveness of our failings, O Christ God; for of Thine own will Thou wast well-pleased to ascend the Cross in the flesh, that Thou mightest deliver from slavery to the enemy those whom Thou hadst fashioned. Wherefore we cry to Thee thankfully: Thou didst fill all things with joy, O our Savior, when Thou camest to save the world."/>
