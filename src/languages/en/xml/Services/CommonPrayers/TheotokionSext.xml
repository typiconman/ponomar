<TEXT Value="For verily, we have no favor for the multitude of our sins. Therefore, O virgin Theotokos, plead
with Him that was born of thee; for the pleadings of the Mother are very effective in seeking the
favor of the Master. Turn thou not away, therefore, from the pleadings of sinners, O most
venerable one; for He Who was willing to suffer for our sins is merciful and able to save us."/>
