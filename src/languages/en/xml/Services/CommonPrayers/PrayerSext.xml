<HEADER Value="Prayer of St. Basil the Great"/>
<TEXT Value="O God, Lord of powers, and Creator of all creatures, for the indescribable compassion of
Thy mercies Thou didst send Thine only Son Jesus Christ for the salvation of our race; and by His
Cross Thou didst tear up the decree of our sins; and through Him didst shame the principals and
kings of darkness. Thou, Master, Lover of mankind, accept from us sinners these petitions and
pleadings of thanksgiving, and deliver us from every dark and annihilating fall, from all those who
seek to do us wrong, and from enemies visible and invisible. Nail the fear of Thee in our bodies,
and turn not our hearts to evil speech or thoughts. Nay, by Thy longing, wound our souls that,
beholding Thee always, and being guided by the light coming from Thee, and observing Thee, O
unapproachable eternal Light, we may address to Thee ceaselessly our thanksgiving and
confession; O Father without beginning, with Thine only Son, and Thy most Holy Spirit, the Giver
of life, now and ever, and unto ages of ages."/>
