<HEADER Value="Nicene Creed"/>
<TEXT Value="I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things
visible and invisible. And in one Lord, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, the only-begotten, begotten
before all worlds: Light of Light, very God of very God, begotten not made, of one essence with
the Father by Whom all things were made. Who for us men, and for our salvation, came down
from heaven, and was incarnate of the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary, and became man. And was
crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate, and suffered and was buried. And on the third day rose
again according to the Scriptures. And ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of the
Father. And He shall come again, with glory, to judge the living and the dead, Whose kingdom
shall have no end. And I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the Giver of life, Who procedeth
from the Father, Who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; Who spake
by the Prophets. And I believe in One, Holy, Catholic and Apostolic Church. I acknowledge one
Baptism for the remission of sins. I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world
to come. Amen."/>
