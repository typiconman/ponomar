<TEXT Value="Most glorified art thou, O Virgin Theotokos; we praise thee, for by the Cross of thy Son, hades was cast down and death slain.  Having been put to death, we were raised up, and were deemed worthy of life.  We received paradise, the ancient bliss.  Wherefore, in thanksgiving, we glorify Christ our God, since He is mighty and alone abundant in mercy."/>
