&lt;p&gt; He was the founder and rector of the Transfiguration Monastery on the Sokhoti River, about 16.5 miles (25 versts) from Poshekhonie, Jaroslavl′ Province. Venerable Sebastian lived in the 15&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century, distinguished by a highly virtuous life and extraordinary diligence. He frequently loved to repeat this to his disciples: “brethren, suffer grief and misfortune that you may avoid eternal torment.” He died in 1542. His relics are in a hidden place in his monastery (see Jaroslavl Diocese). &lt;/p&gt;
