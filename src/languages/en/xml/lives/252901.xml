&lt;p&gt;Born in the village of Petra (in Morea), he was tonsured as an ascetic on Mount Athos. He died in peace in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century. In 1815 the relics of Nilus were discovered uncorrupted and sweet smelling. Today part of them is in the temple constructed on the place of the ascetical efforts of the Venerable Nilus and the rest in the Athonite Laura. &lt;/p&gt;
