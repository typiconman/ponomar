&lt;p&gt;     Born in Arabia, together with his brother St. Theodore (see December 27), he was a zealous advocate of iconolatry during the reigns of the Emperors Leo the Armenian, Michael the Stammerer and Theophilus. His suffering for the holy icons continued for 25 years. During the reign of the Emperor Theophilus they after cruel torture cut an inscription into his skin with needles. He died about the year 847. He composed about 145 church Canons. According to the words of the Church, "with ascetic labors" and "with the fervor of abstention " he withered "the sweet passions", and by his speech "of systematic words" washed away "the heretical darkness" and lightened up "the heretical haze". &lt;/p&gt;
