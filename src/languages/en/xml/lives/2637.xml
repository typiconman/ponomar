<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
&lt;p&gt;       Born in the Serbian village of Epibata (between Silinaurius and Constantinople) she was brought up in a pious family. After the death of her parents and hating “the vain seductive way of life” she, “as a faithful faster” and “an adornment of virgins”, entered monasticism and left for the Jordan valley, where she practiced asceticism up to old age. Here “by works of fasting”, “by true affection and perfect humility” she overcame the “demon’s hosts” and “bodily passions” and lived a “bodiless life in a material body”. Within two years of her death obeying a call from heaven, she returned to her home country and settled in the temple of the Holy Apostles, where she died peacefully (in first half of the 11th century). In the year 1238 by the order of Tsar John Asen, the relics of Venerable Parasceva were transferred to Trnovo, the capital of Bulgaria; upon the capture of this city by the Sultan Bayazid the relics were transferred to Jassy, the capital of Wallachia. After Wallachia fell to the Turks in 1396 the pious Serbian Prince Militsa begged for the relics of the Venerable Parasceva and they were transferred to Belgrade. In 1521 they were bought by the Turks, who took them from Belgrade and transferred them to Constantinople, and in 1641 to Jassy, where they repose to this day in the cathedral. &lt;/p&gt;

<TROPARION Type="1" Tone="4" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
&lt;p&gt;Having loved the hermetic and silent life, and having longingly run in the footsteps of thy bridegroom Christ, thou didst accept His good yoke in thy tender years. By the sign of the Cross thou courageously fought against the nœtic enemies; through asceticism, fasting, prayer and the shedding of tears, thou didst quench the burning coals of the passions. O Parasceva, worthy of glory: standing now before Christ in the heavenly bridal chamber, together with the wise virgins, pray for us, who honour thy memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Holy intercessor of all who are in trouble, let us piously hymn the All-honorable Parasceva: for she rejected the corruptible and accepted the incorruptible way of life forever: therefore she obtained glory, the grace of wonders, by the command of God.&lt;/p&gt;
