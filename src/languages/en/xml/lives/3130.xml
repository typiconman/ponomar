&lt;p&gt;Tenth of the Twelve Minor Prophets, he belonged to the root of Levi and prophesied during the reign of the Persian King Darius Hystaspes (about 500 years before the Nativity of Christ). After the return of the Jews from the Babylonian captivity, he convinced them to build the second temple in Jerusalem and calmed them that in this temple lies “the Word without Beginning in the last times is manifest.” &lt;/p&gt;
