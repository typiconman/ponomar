&lt;p&gt;He was the chief of the Niberta Island (in Spain, near Cadiz), but then, having disdained secular vanity, he accepted monasticism in Rome and went to travel to the holy places. He was in Constantinople and Jerusalem where he accepted the schema. He died as a martyr in Egypt in the tenth century, being killed for his faith in Christ by the Saracens. &lt;/p&gt;
