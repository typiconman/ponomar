<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
&lt;p&gt; They suffered for Christ during the persecution of Decius in the city of Emesa, Ph≈ìnicia. St. Galaction, being a Christian, according to the will of his parents, was betrothed to the pagan Epistime. Having instructed her in the holy faith, St. Galaction convinced her to lead a virgin life, and was himself tonsured as a monk on Mount Publion near Sinai. During the persecution when he was seized for torture, St. Epistime voluntarily joined him to share with him the cup of suffering. After severe tortures both holy martyrs were beheaded. &lt;/p&gt;
