&lt;p&gt;The Holy Martyrs Carpus and Papylus (also those with them: Agathadorus and Agathonica) suffered for Christ in the city of Pergamon, during the persecution under Emperor Decius, about 251. St. Carpus was the bishop of Thyatira, and St. Papylus was his deacon. After being tortured in Thyatira, Sts. Carpus and Papylus were sent, tied to horses, to the city of Sardis. St. Agathadorus voluntarily was sent with them. Here "the dedicated one" Agathadorus, courageously endured "wounds and cuts", and died during severe torture. Sts. Carpus and Papylus were again returned to Pergamon and there, after a miraculous deliverance from a fiery furnace, were beheaded by the sword. St. Agathonica, the sister of St. Papylus, also was beheaded. In the service for this day, we hymn the Holy Martyrs Carpus and Papylus, and we also commemorate Sts. Agathadorus and Agathonica.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy martyrs, O Lord, in their suffering received crowns of incorruption from Thee, our God; for having Thy might they deposed the tormentors and destroyed the powerless audacity of the dæmons. Through their prayers do Thou save our souls.&lt;/p&gt;

<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="4" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
&lt;p&gt;As a valuable treasury of the Master And a fountain pouring out streams of healings You gave your relics to those on the earth. Thus they are removing the infirmities of various passions Ceaselessly granting grace to our souls. Therefore, O Divine Martyrs, with one voice we celebrate your festival with love.&lt;/p&gt;
