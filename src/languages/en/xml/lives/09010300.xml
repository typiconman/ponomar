During the persecution of the Emperor Leo the Isaurian against the Holy Icons, the wonderworking image depicting the Synaxis of the Theotokos and found in the Miasini Monastery in Armenia was thrown into Lake Azurov. Within 100 years after the restoration of icon veneration, this holy icon appeared in the year 864 completely unharmed on the surface of the water. The feast is established in memory of this appearance that happened on September 1.
