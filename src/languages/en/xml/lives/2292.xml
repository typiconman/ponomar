<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
&lt;p&gt;One of the 70 Apostles, he was one of the seven deacons chosen by the Apostles and worked together with Archdeacon Stephen. He was born in Cæsarea, Palestine. When persecution was raised against the Church in Jerusalem, Philip was not frightened by the "lawless fury", departed to Samaria and preached Christ to them and here converted many to Christ. Among others he baptized Simon Magus and the nobleman eunuch of Candace the Queen of Ethiopia (Acts 8:5-13, 26-39). As a bishop Saint Philip preached Christ in Tralles, Lydia where he destroyed many "temples of idols". He died at a very old age. His four virgin daughters were granted the gift of prophecy (Acts 21:8-9). One of them, Hermione (see September 4), accepted the martyr”s death and is numbered among the saints. This holy apostle should be distinguished from the Apostle Philip, who is commemorated on November 14.&lt;/p&gt;</LIFE>
