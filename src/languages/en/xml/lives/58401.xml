St. Daniel was born in Serbia, the son of rich and famous parents. Aspiring to asceticism, he accepted monasticism in the Konchulsk Monastery. From here he went to Mt. Athos where he became the Hegumen of the Hilandar Monastery. In 1325, Daniel was elected Archbishop of Serbia and most successfully deflected the attacks of the Pope of Rome. Serbia is obliged to St. Daniel for the construction of many churches and cultivation of vineyards. He died in 1338.
