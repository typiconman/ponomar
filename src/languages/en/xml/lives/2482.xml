<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
&lt;p&gt;He was born in the village of Marikata (Bithynia), and in his youth was a shepherd. Later he served his country on the battlefield and then left the vanity of the world for Mount Olympus and there practiced asceticism as a hermit for many years in the wildest and most deserted places. Through an unremitting battle with his passions, indefatigable works, vigil and prayer "having cleansed the passions of darkness" "and having destroyed the flesh", he trampled down "the nets of the enemy", achieved sanctity, having become "a co-participant with angels". God awarded St. Joannicius the Great wisdom, insight and the gift of wonderworking. He died in 846. Many came to the holy ascetic for edification and intercession of the saints by his prayers and petitions before God and much spiritual compassion flowed from the venerable one. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a flood of tears thou madest the desert fertile, and thy longing for God brought forth fruits in abundance. By the radiance of miracles thou didst illumine the whole universe! O our holy father Joannicius, pray to Christ our God that our souls may be saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thou wast revealed as a glistening star, enlightening the world, and shining on those who are in the darkness of passions: thou wast revealed a mightiest physician, but as thou received the grace of healing, to those that ask thee grant healing, that we may cry out: Rejoice O Father Joannicius. &lt;/p&gt;
