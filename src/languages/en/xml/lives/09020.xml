The Monk Publius (Poplios) of Syria was born in the city of Zeugma on the Euphrates and had the rank of senator. Renouncing the world, he gave off his possessions, took monastic vows and asceticised in a cave on a mountain in the Syrian wilderness, where he founded two monasteries: one for Greeks, and another for Syrians. He died in the year 380. Of his disciples who imitated Saint Poplios—Saints Theoteknos, Theodotos and Athonios were in particular glorified by sanctity of life. Saint Poplios in guiding the monastery for over 40 years was eventually granted the dignity of archimandrite, but being elevated in rank he changed neither his garb nor his manner of life, remaining instead a strict ascetic.
