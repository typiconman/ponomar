&lt;p&gt;       Before he was a monk he was glorified by a strict life and zealousness for honoring holy icons. As the Bishop of Sardis he participated in the Seventh Ecumenical Council where he defended the holy icon with zealousness. For his Orthodox conviction St. Euthymius was honed three times and, finally, during the reign of Emperor Theophilus (840) was whipped to death with ox-hide straps. His relics, glorified by many wonders, repose in the city of Anchialus on the Black Sea. &lt;/p&gt;
