&lt;p&gt;On the second day of the Nativity of Christ the Holy Church invites its faithful children for the thanksgiving glorification of the All-holy Virgin, who has contributed to the great mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God. Because of this the day is called the “Synaxis of the All-holy Theotokos” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy nativity, O Christ our God, * hath shone forth the light of knowledge upon the world; * for therein those who worship the stars * have been taught by a star to worship Thee, * the Sun of righteousness, * and to know Thee the Orient from on high. ** O Lord, glory be to Thee!&lt;/p&gt;

<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="3">
&lt;p&gt;Today the Virgin giveth birth unto the Transcendent One, * and the earth offereth a cave to the unapproachable One. * Angels and shepherds give glory, * the magi journey with the star. ** For unto us a Child is born, the preeternal God.&lt;/p&gt;

<KONTAKION Type="2" Tone="6">
&lt;p&gt;He Who was born of the Father without mother before the morning star * hath today become incarnate of thee on earth without father; * wherefore, the star announceth glad tidings to the magi, ** and the angels and shepherds hymn thine ineffable birthgiving, O thou who art full of grace.&lt;/p&gt;
