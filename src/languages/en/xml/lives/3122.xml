&lt;p&gt;O most glorious Paul, we hymn thee * as one who dwelleth together with the incorporeal hosts * and as a companion of all the venerable, ** and we beseech thee: ** Pray thou ever for us, that we may find mercy.&lt;/p&gt;

<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="0">
&lt;p&gt;From thy youth, O wise one, thou didst manfully desire that which passeth understanding * and didst forsake the tumult of the world. * For thy divine way of life thou becamest a dwelling-place of the Trinity, * and hast illumined those who have recourse to thee with faith. ** Wherefore, we cry out: Rejoice, O Paul who art most rich!&lt;/p&gt;
