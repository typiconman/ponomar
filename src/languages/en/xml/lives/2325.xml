&lt;p&gt;The Monk Thomas the Maleian was a military commander before accepting monasticism. Powerful and brave, he had participated in many a battle, and he brought victory to his countrymen, for which he gained glory and esteem. But, striving with all his heart towards God, Thomas left the world with its honours and he took monastic vows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With great humility he visited monastic-elders, asking of them guidance in the spiritual life. After several years Thomas received the blessing for solitary wilderness life and, strengthened in particular by a revelation through the holy prophet of God Elias, he settled on Mount Maleia (eastern part of Athos). Dwelling in complete seclusion, Saint Thomas fought with invisible enemies with suchlike a courage, as before he had against the visible enemies of his country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The life and deeds of Saint Thomas were not able to be concealed from the surrounding area. People began to flock to him seeking spiritual guidance, and even those suffering from sickness, since he received from God the blessing to heal infirmities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many believers received help through the prayers of the monk and upon his departure to God (X). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truly thou didst show forth a great victory! * Wherefore, aflame with divine life, thou didst vanquish the corrupt king and all beautiful things, * making thine abode on Mount Maleum, * from whence thou didst ascend to the King of kings in the heavens. ** O Thomas, pray thou unceasingly for us all.&lt;/p&gt;
