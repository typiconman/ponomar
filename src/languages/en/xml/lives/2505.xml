Born in Methymna (on the island of Lesbos), she in her youth was tonsured into monasticism in the women”s monastery. Captured by pirates who raided the monastery, they took her to the island of Paros. But there she fled from them, saving her virginity. Finding on the island a dilapidated temple, she began to submit to ascetical efforts in it, constantly abiding in prayer and eating only vegetables. In this way the Venerable Theoctiste led her life for 35 years and died in peace in the year 881.       The service for the Venerable Theoctiste is sung at Compline.
