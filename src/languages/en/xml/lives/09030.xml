&lt;p&gt;“Three Saints”—the Synaxis (Assembly; Slavonic Соборъ) of the Holy Œcumenical Teachers of the Church and Saint-Hierarchs: Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian, and John Chrysostom: At Constantinople for a long time there raged disputes about which one of the three sainted-hierarchs should be accorded the primacy of honour. One faction of the people preferred Saint Basil (Comm. 1 January), others stood forth for Saint Gregory the Theologian (Comm. 25 January), while a third reverenced Saint John Chrysostom (Comm. 13 November). &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;From this arose among church factions amongst Christians: some called themselves Basilians, others–Gregorians, and the third–Johannites. In accord with the will of God, in the year 1084 the three sainted-hierarchs appeared to the Euchantine metropolitan John, and in declaring that they were equal before God, they gave orders that the disputes should stop and that a day in common celebration of their memory should be established. &lt;/p&gt;
