from captivity, since He is the Lover of mankind.

come to Thee in the likeness of a dove. Dwell Thou, therefore, in our souls, O Lover of mankind.

abominable idolatry, our souls may be illuminated by Him.

Why are thy waters troubled, O Jordan, and why turnest thou backward, not proceeding forward
according to thy natural flow? It shall answer, saying, I cannot bear a consuming fire. Therefore,
do I marvel and tremble at Thine exceeding condescension; for I am not accustomed to wash the
Pure; I have not learned to purify the sinless One, but to purify impure vessels. Christ, who
January 05 Royal Hours 15 Theophany of Christ
baptized in me, doth teach me to burn the thorns of sins. And John, the voice of the Word, doth
testify with me, crying, Behold the Lamb of God Who beareth the sin of the world. Let us believers
therefore cry unto Him, saying, O God that hath appeared for our salvation, glory to Thee.

It is an astonishing thing how the Maker of heaven and earth is seen naked in the river, accepting

Verily, the Forerunner, seeing the Lord of glory coming towards him, cried, saying, Behold the
Redeemer of the world cometh from corruption. Behold, He rescueth us from sorrow. Behold,
He Who granteth forgiveness of sins hath come to the earth from a pure Virgin, of His own
mercy. Wherefore, He maketh us sons of God instead of servants; and instead of darkness He
illuminateth mankind with the water of His divine baptism. Let us, therefore, glorify Him in
unison with the Father and the Holy Spirit.
