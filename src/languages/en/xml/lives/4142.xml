&lt;p&gt;The Holy Martyr Jacinthus (Hyacinth), a native of Cæsarea Cappadocia, grew up in a Christian family. The Roman emperor Trajan made him his “cubicularius” (bed-chamberlain).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once during the time of a pagan festival the emperor Trajan was feasting in a pagan-temple together with his companions, eating of the idol-offered food, but the youth Jacinthus, having remained at the palace, shut himself up in a small room and prayed fervently to the Lord Jesus Christ. One of the servants overheard the words of prayer. He made a denunciation to the emperor, that Jacinthus, entrusted with an imperial position, did not honour the Roman gods but was secretly praying to Christ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They immediately arrested Saint Jacinthus and led him to Trajan. The emperor demanded that he eat of the idol-offered meat, but the saint bravely refused and declared himself a Christian. By order of Trajan, they locked up the holy martyr in prison after fierce tortures, and they exhausted him with hunger and thirst, so as to force him to eat of idolatrous food. On the 38&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; day, one of the guards, bringing the idol-offering meat, saw Angels alongside the martyr, dressing him in bright attire and placing on his head a crown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The torturers decided to continue with the trial over the saint, but they found him in prison already dead. The twelve year old Jacinthus died in the year 108 in the city of Rome. They afterwards transferred the relics of the saint to Cæsarea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy martyr, O Christ, having acquired Thy Faith, * like a tree of life in the midst of his soul, * became more honorable than the Garden of Eden, * boldly destroying the tree of the serpent”s deception by his spirit, * and he was crowned with thy glory, ** O greatly Merciful One.&lt;/p&gt;
