<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Copyright="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
&lt;p&gt; The Holy Apostle Andrew consecrated St. Stachys as Bishop of Byzantium, over which he was hierarch for 16 years and died in peace. St. Amplias was Bishop in Diospolis (Lydda), and St. Urban in Macedonia. The Apostle Andrew consecrated both of them as bishops, and they zealously preached Christ to the pagans and for this they died as martyrs from both Jews and Hellenes. St. Narcissus was bishop in Athens. St. Apelles was hierarch in Heraclea. See March 16 concerning the Holy Apostle Aristobulus. In the church services all these are called Holy Apostles.&lt;/p&gt;
