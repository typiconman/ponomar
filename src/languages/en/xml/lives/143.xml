&lt;p&gt;The Holy Prophet Malachi lived 400 years before the Birth of Christ, during the time of the return of the Jews from the Babylonian Captivity. Malachi was the last of the Old Testament prophets, wherefore the holy fathers call him “the sealing-shut of the prophets.” Manifesting himself an image of spiritual goodness and piety, he astounded the nation and was called Malachiei, &lt;i&gt;i.e.&lt;/i&gt; an angel or messenger. In the Canon of Scriptural Books is included also his prophetic book, in which he upbraids the Jews, foretelling the coming of Jesus Christ and His Forerunner, and also the Last Judgement (Mal. 3: 1-5; 4:1-6).&lt;/p&gt;
