&lt;p&gt;    They were burnt and others outside the church suffered there. In 302 the Emperor Maximian Hercules offered solemn sacrifices to the gods in Nicomedia in celebration of his victories. Christians, who casually were in the area, began to leave afraid of being sprinkled with the blood of idol-sacrifice. Angry with them the Emperor ordered to burn the Christians of Nicomedia together with their temple when they gathered for celebrating the Nativity of Christ. According to the Synodal Menologion of 1862, soon after the burning of these holy martyrs the following holy martyrs died from various tortures: Indes, Gorgonius, Peter, Zeno, Dorotheus, Mardonius, Migdonius, Glycerias, Theophilus, Euthymius and the maidens: Domna, Agatha, and Theophila. The following names of martyrs are listed in the service of this day: Theophilus, Dorotheus, Migdonius, Gorgonius, Secondus, Peter, Indes and Anthimus. The names of the holy martyrs Secundus and Anthimus are not mentioned in the Synodal Menaion of 1863 and 1891 (Refer to Sep. 3). &lt;/p&gt;
