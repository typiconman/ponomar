He was born in Murom and practiced asceticism in the Kievan Monastery of the Caves in the Twelfth Century. His relics repose in the St. Anthony’s Cave. In the words of Philaret, Archbishop of Chernigov, Ven. Elias reposes in a prayerful position and irresistibly accuses the schism (Raskol): his first three fingers are joined together and outstretched, but the last two, the fourth and fifth fingers, are folded into his palm.
