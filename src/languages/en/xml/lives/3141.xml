&lt;p&gt;He was born in Sebastea. Brought up in piety, St. Modestus at first practiced asceticism on Sinai, and then in his declining years was installed as the archbishop of Jerusalem. The hierarch labored hard at the restoration of Jerusalem and its churches destroyed by the Persians, and died in peace in 634. The Prologue narrates this about him: “A certain Jerusalem man’s cattle was dying, spewing out a stream of serpent’s venom, with diabolical slander, he found a saint for this, who raised up the cattle and destroyed the serpents” &lt;/p&gt;
