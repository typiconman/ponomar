1|  These <i>are</i> the words which Moses spoke to all Israel on this side Jordan in the desert towards the west near the Red Sea, between Pharan Tophol, and Lobon, and Aulon, and the gold works. 
2| <i>It is</i> a journey of eleven days from Choreb to mount Seir as far as Cades Barne. 
3| And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, Moses spoke to all the children of Israel, according to all things which the Lord commanded him for them: 
4| after he had smitten Seon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Esebon, and Og the king of Basan who dwelt in Astaroth and in Edrain; 
5| beyond Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to declare this law, saying, 
6| The Lord your God spoke to us in Choreb, saying, Let it suffice you to have dwelt <i>so long</i> in this mountain. 
7| Turn ye and depart and enter into the mountain of the Amorites, and <i>go</i> to all that dwell near about Araba, to the mountain and the plain and to the south, and the land of the Chananites near the sea, and Antilibanus, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 
8| Behold, <i>God</i> has delivered the land before you; go in and inherit the land, which I sware to your fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give it to them and to their seed after them. 
9| And I spoke to you at that time, saying, I shall not be able by myself to bear you. 
10| The Lord your God has multiplied you, and, behold, ye are to-day as the stars of heaven for multitude. 
11| The Lord God of your fathers add to you a thousand-fold more than you are, and bless you as he has spoken to you. 
12| How shall I alone be able to bear your labour, and your burden, and your gainsayings? 
13| Take to yourselves wise and understanding and prudent men for your tribes, and I will set your leaders over you. 
14| And ye answered me and said, The thing which thou hast told us <i>is</i> good to do. 
15| So I took of you wise and understanding and prudent men, and I set them to rule over you as rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, and rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens, and officers to your judges. 
16| And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear <i>causes</i> between your brethren, and judge rightly between a man and <i>his</i> brother, and the stranger that is with him. 
17| Thou shalt not have respect to persons in judgment, thou shalt judge small and great equally; thou shalt not shrink from before the person of a man, for the judgment is God’s; and whatsoever matter shall be too hard for you, ye shall bring it to me, and I will hear it. 
18| And I charged upon you at that time all the commands which ye shall perform. 
19| And we departed from Choreb, and went through all that great wilderness and terrible, which ye saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite, as the Lord our God charged us, and we came as far as Cades Barne. 
20| And I said to you, Ye have come as far as the mountain of the Amorite, which the Lord our God gives to you: 
21| behold, the Lord your God has delivered to us the land before you: go up and inherit it as the Lord God of your fathers said to you; fear not, neither be afraid. 
22| And ye all came to me, and said, Let us send men before us, and let them go up to the land for us; and let them bring back to us a report of the way by which we shall go up, and of the cities into which we shall enter. 
23| And the saying pleased me: and I took of you twelve men, one man of a tribe. 
24| And they turned and went up to the mountain, and they came as far as the valley of the cluster, and surveyed it. 
25| And they took in their hands of the fruit of the land, and brought it to you, and said, The land is good which the Lord our God gives us.  
26| Yet ye would not go up, but rebelled against the words of the Lord our God. 
27| And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us, he has brought us out of the land of Egypt to deliver us into the hands of the Amorites, to destroy us. 
28| Whither do we go up? and your brethren drew away your heart, saying, <i>It is a</i> great nation and populous, and mightier than we; and <i>there are</i> cities great and walled up to heaven: moreover we saw there the sons of the giants. 
29| And I said to you, Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them; 
30| the Lord your God who goes before your face, he shall fight against them together with you effectually, according to all that he wrought for you in the land of Egypt; 
31| and in this wilderness which ye saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorite; how the Lord thy God will bear thee as a nursling, as if any man should nurse his child, through all the way which ye have gone until ye came to this place.  
32| And in this matter ye believed not the Lord our God, 
33| who goes before you in the way to choose you a place, guiding you in fire by night, shewing you the way by which ye go, and a cloud by day.  
34| And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and being greatly provoked he sware, saying, 
35| Not one of these men shall see this good land, which I sware to their fathers, 
36| except Chaleb the son of Jephonne, he shall see it; and to him I will give the land on which he went up, and to his sons, because he attended to the things of the Lord. 
37| And the Lord was angry with me for your sake, saying, Neither shalt thou by any means enter therein. 
38| Joshua the son of Naue, who stands by thee, he shall enter in there; do thou strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 
39| And every young child who this day knows not good or evil, —they shall enter therein, and to them I will give it, and they shall inherit it. 
40| And ye turned and marched into the wilderness, in the way by the Red Sea.  
41| And ye answered and said, We have sinned before the Lord our God; we will go up and fight according to all that the Lord our God has commanded us: and having taken every one his weapons of war, and being gathered together, ye went up to the mountain. 
42| And the Lord said to me, Tell them, Ye shall not go up, neither shall ye fight, for I am not with you; thus shall ye not be destroyed before your enemies. 
43| And I spoke to you, and ye did not hearken to me; and ye transgressed the commandment of the Lord; and ye forced your way and went up into the mountain. 
44| And the Amorite who dwelt in that mountain came out to meet you, and pursued you as bees do, and wounded you from Seir to Herma. 
45| And ye sat down and wept before the Lord our God, and the Lord hearkened not to your voice, neither did he take heed to you.  
46| And ye dwelt in Cades many days, as many days as ye dwelt <i>there</i>.

1| And we turned and departed into the wilderness, by the way of the Red Sea, as the Lord spoke to me, and we compassed mount Seir many days. 
2| And the Lord said to me, 
3| Ye have compassed this mount long enough; turn therefore toward the north. 
4| And charge the people, saying, Ye are going through the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they shall fear you, and dread you greatly. 
5| Do not engage in war against them, for I will not give you of their land even enough to set your foot upon, for I have given mount Seir to the children of Esau as an inheritance. 
6| Buy food of them for money and eat, and ye shall receive water of them by measure for money, and drink. 
7| For the Lord our God has blessed thee in every work of thy hands. Consider how thou wentest through that great and terrible wilderness: behold, the Lord thy God <i>has been</i> with thee forty years; thou didst not lack any thing. 
8| And we passed by our brethren the children of Esau, who dwelt in Seir, by the way of Araba from Ælon and from Gesion Gaber; and we turned and passed by the way of the desert of Moab. 
9| And the Lord said to me, Do not ye quarrel with the Moabites, and do not engage in war with them; for I will not give you of their land for an inheritance, for I have given Aroer to the children of Lot to inherit. 
10| Formerly the Ommin dwelt in it, a great and numerous nation and powerful, like the Enakim. 
11| These also shall be accounted Raphain like the Enakim; and the Moabites call them Ommin. 
12| And the Chorrhite dwelt in Seir before, and the sons of Esau destroyed them, and utterly consumed them from before them; and they dwelt in their place, as Israel did to the land of his inheritance, which the Lord gave to them. 
13| Now then, arise ye, <i>said I</i>, and depart, and cross the valley of Zaret.  
14| And the days in which we traveled from Cades Barne till we crossed the valley of Zaret, <i>were</i> thirty and eight years, until the whole generation of the men of war failed, dying out of the camp, as the Lord God sware to them. 
15| And the hand of the Lord was upon them to destroy them out of the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.  
16| And it came to pass when all the men of war dying out of the midst of the people had fallen, 
17| that the Lord spoke to me, saying, 
18| Thou shalt pass over this day the borders of Moab to Aroer; 
19| and ye shall draw nigh to the children of Amman: do not quarrel with them, nor wage war with them; for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Amman for an inheritance, because I have given it to the children of Lot for an inheritance. 
20| It shall be accounted a land of Raphain, for the Raphain dwelt there before, and the Ammanites call them Zochommin. 
21| A great nation and populous, and mightier than you, as also the Enakim: yet the Lord destroyed them from before them, and they inherited <i>their land</i>, and they dwelt <i>there</i> instead of them until this day. 
22| As they did to the children of Esau that dwell in Seir, even as they destroyed the Chorrhite from before them, and inherited their country, and dwelt <i>therein</i> instead of them until this day. 
23| And the Evites who dwell in Asedoth to Gaza, and the Cappadocians who came out of Cappadocia, destroyed them, and dwelt in their room. 
24| Now then arise and depart, and pass over the valley of Arnon: behold, I have delivered into thy hands Seon the king of Esebon the Amorite, and his land: begin to inherit <i>it</i>: engage in war with him this day. 
25| Begin to put thy terror and thy fear on the face of all the nations under heaven, who shall be troubled when they have heard thy name, and shall be in anguish before thee.  
26| And I sent ambassadors from the wilderness of Kedamoth to Seon king of Esebon with peaceable words, saying, 
27| I will pass through thy land: I will go by the road, I will not turn aside to the right hand or to the left. 
28| Thou shalt give me food for money, and I will eat; and thou shalt give me water for money, and I will drink; I will only go through on my feet: 
29| as the sons of Esau did to me, who dwelt in Seir, and the Moabites who dwelt in Aroer, until I shall have passed Jordan into the land which the Lord our God gives us. 
30| And Seon king of Esebon would not that we should pass by him, because the Lord our God hardened his spirit, and made his heart stubborn, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as on this day.  
31| And the Lord said to me, Behold, I have begun to deliver before thee Seon the king of Esebon the Amorite, and his land, and do thou begin to inherit his land. 
32| And Seon the king of Esebon came forth to meet us, he and all his people to war at Jassa. 
33| And the Lord our God delivered him before our face, and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. 
34| And we took possession of all his cities at that time, and we utterly destroyed every city in succession, and their wives, and their children; we left no living prey. 
35| Only we took the cattle captive, and took the spoil of the cities. 
36| From Aroer, which is by the brink of the brook of Arnon, and the city which is in the valley, and as far as the mount of Galaad; there was not a city which escaped us: the Lord our God delivered all of them into our hands. 
37| Only we did not draw near to the children of Amman, even all the parts bordering on the brook Jaboc, and the cities in the mountain country, as the Lord our God charged us.   

#3
1| And we turned and went by the way leading to Basan; and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us, he and all his people, to battle at Edraim. 
2| And the Lord said to me, Fear him not, for I have delivered him, and all his people, and all his land, into thy hands; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Seon king of the Amorites who dwelt in Esebon. 
3| And the Lord our God delivered him into our hands, even Og the king of Basan, and all his people; and we smote him until we left none of his seed.  
4| And we mastered all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we took not from them; sixty cities, all the country round about Argob, belonging to king Og in Basan: 
5| all strong cities, lofty walls, gates and bars; besides the very many cities of the Pherezites. 
6| We utterly destroyed <i>them</i> as we dealt with Seon the king of Esebon, so we utterly destroyed every city in order, and the women and the children, 
7| and all the cattle; and we took for a prey to ourselves the spoil of the cities.  
8| And we took at that time the land out of the hands of the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, <i>extending</i> from the brook of Arnon even unto Aermon. 
9| The Phoenicians call Aermon Sanior, but the Amorite has called it Sanir. 
10| All the cities of Misor, and all Galaad, and all Basan as far as Elcha and Edraim, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan. 
11| For only Og the king of Basan was left of the Raphain: behold, his bed <i>was</i> a bed of iron; behold, <i>it is</i> in the chief city of the children of Ammon; the length of it <i>is</i> nine cubits, and the breadth of it four cubits, according to the cubit of a man. 
12| And we inherited that land at that time from Aroer, which is by the border of the torrent Arnon, and half the mount of Galaad; and I gave his cities to Ruben and to Gad. 
13| And the rest of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og I gave to the half-tribe of Manasse, and all the country round about Argob, all that Basan; it shall be accounted the land of Raphain. 
14| And Jair the son of Manasse took all the country round about Argob as far as the borders of Gargasi and Machathi: he called them by his name Basan Thavoth Jair until this day. 
15| And to Machir I gave Galaad. 
16| And to Ruben and to Gad I gave <i>the land</i> under Galaad as far as the brook of Arnon, the border between the brook and as far as Jaboc; the brook <i>is</i> the border to the children Amman. 
17| And Araba and Jordan <i>are</i> the boundary of Machanareth, even to the sea of Araba, the salt sea under Asedoth Phasga eastward.  
18| And I charged you at that time, saying, The Lord your God has given you this land by lot; arm yourselves, every one <i>that is</i> powerful, and go before your brethren the children of Israel. 
19| Only your wives and your children and your cattle (I know that ye have much cattle), let them dwell in your cities which I have given you; 
20| until the Lord your God give your brethren rest, as also he has given to you, and they also shall inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives them on the other side of Jordan; then ye shall return, each one to his inheritance which I have given you. 
21| And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Your eyes have seen all things, which the Lord our God did to these two kings: so shall the Lord our God do to all the kingdoms against which thou crossest over thither. 
22| Ye shall not be afraid of them, because the Lord our God himself shall fight for you.  
23| And I besought the Lord at that time, saying, 
24| Lord God, thou hast begun to shew to thy servant thy strength, and thy power, and thy mighty hand, and thy high arm: for what God is there in heaven or on the earth, who will do as thou hast done, and according to thy might? 
25| I will therefore go over and see this good land that is beyond Jordan, this good mountain and Antilibanus.  
26| And the Lord because of you did not regard me, and hearkened not to me; and the Lord said to me, Let it suffice thee, speak not of this matter to me any more. 
27| Go up to the top of the quarried rock, and look with thine eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold <i>it</i> with thine eyes, for thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
28| And charge Joshua, and strengthen him, and encourage him; for he shall go before the face of this people, and he shall give them the inheritance of all the land which thou hast seen. 
29| And we abode in the valley near the house of Phogor.

1| And now, Israel, hear the ordinances and judgments, all that I teach you this day to do: that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives you. 
2| Ye shall not add to the word which I command you, and ye shall not take from it: keep the commandments of the Lord our God, all that I command you this day. 
3| Your eyes have seen all that the Lord our God did in <i>the case of</i> Beel-phegor; for every man that went after Beel-phegor, the Lord your God has utterly destroyed him from among you. 
4| But ye that kept close to the Lord your God are all alive to-day.  
5| Behold, I have shewn you ordinances and judgments as the Lord commanded me, that ye should do so in the land into which ye go to inherit it. 
6| And ye shall keep and do them: for this is your wisdom and understanding before all nations, as many as shall hear all these ordinances; and they shall say, Behold, this great nation <i>is</i> a wise and understanding people. 
7| For what manner of nation <i>is so</i> great, which has God so near to them as the Lord our God <i>is</i> in all things in whatsoever we may call upon him? 
8| And what manner of nation <i>is so</i> great, which has righteous ordinances and judgments according to all this law, which I set before you this day?  
9| Take heed to thyself, and keep thy heart diligently: forget not any of the things, which thine eyes have seen, and let them not depart from thine heart all the days of thy life; and thou shalt teach thy sons and thy sons’ sons, 
10| <i>even the things that happened in</i> the day in which ye stood before the Lord our God in Choreb in the day of the assembly; for the Lord said to me, Gather the people to me, and let them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days which they live upon the earth, and they shall teach their sons. 
11| And ye drew nigh and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire up to heaven: <i>there was</i> darkness, blackness, <i>and</i> tempest. 
12| And the Lord spoke to you out of the midst of the fire a voice of words, which ye heard: and ye saw no likeness, only <i>ye heard</i> a voice. 
13| And he announced to you his covenant, which he commanded you to keep, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.  
14| And the Lord commanded me at that time, to teach you ordinances and judgments, that ye should do them on the land, into which ye go to inherit it. 
15| And take good heed to your hearts, for ye saw no similitude in the day in which the Lord spoke to you in Choreb in the mountain out of the midst of the fire: 
16| lest ye transgress, and make to yourselves a carved image, any kind of figure, the likeness of male or female, 
17| the likeness of any beast of those that are on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird which flies under heaven, 
18| the likeness of any reptile which creeps on the earth, the likeness of any fish of those which are in the waters under the earth; 
19| and lest having looked up to the sky, and having seen the sun and the moon and the stars, and all the heavenly bodies, thou shouldest go astray and worship them, and serve them, which the Lord thy God has distributed to all the nations under heaven. 
20| But God took you, and led you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.  
21| And the Lord God was angry with me for the things said by you, and sware that I should not go over this Jordan, and that I should not enter into the land, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance. 
22| For I am to die in this land, and shall not pass over this Jordan; but ye are to pass over, and shall inherit this good land. 
23| Take heed to yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the Lord our God, which he made with you, and ye transgress, and make to yourselves a graven image of any of the things concerning which the Lord thy God commanded thee. 
24| For the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God.  
25| And when thou shalt have begotten sons, and shalt have sons’ sons, and ye shall have dwelt a long time on the land, and shall have transgressed, and made a graven image of any thing, and shall have done wickedly before the Lord your God to provoke him; 
26| I call heaven and earth this day to witness against you, that ye shall surely perish from off the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it there; ye shall not prolong your days upon it, but shall be utterly cut off. 
27| And the Lord shall scatter you among all nations, and ye shall be left few in number among all the nations, among which the Lord shall bring you. 
28| And ye shall there serve other gods, the works of the hands of men, wood and stones, which cannot see, nor can they hear, nor eat, nor smell. 
29| And there ye shall seek the Lord your God, and ye shall find him whenever ye shall seek him with all your heart, and with all your soul in your affliction. 
30| And all these things shall come upon thee in the last days, and thou shalt turn to the Lord thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice. 
31| Because the Lord thy God <i>is</i> a God of pity: he will not forsake thee, nor destroy thee; he will not forget the covenant of thy fathers, which the Lord sware to them.  
32| Ask of the former days which were before thee, from the day when God created man upon the earth, and <i>beginning</i> at the <i>one</i> end of heaven to the other end of heaven, if there has happened any thing like to this great event, if such a thing has been heard: 
33| if a nation have heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as thou hast heard and hast lived; 
34| if God has assayed to go and take to himself a nation out of the midst of <i>another</i> nation with trial, and with signs, and with wonders, and with war, and with a mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights, according to all the things which the Lord our God did in Egypt in thy sight. 
35| So that thou shouldest know that the Lord thy God he is God, and there is none beside him. 
36| His voice was made audible from heaven to instruct thee, and he shewed thee upon the earth his great fire, and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.  
37| Because he loved thy fathers, he also chose you their seed after them, and he brought thee himself with his great strength out of Egypt, 
38| to destroy nations great and stronger than thou before thy face, to bring thee in, to give thee their land to inherit, as thou hast it this day.  
39| An thou shalt know this day, and shalt consider in thine heart, that the Lord thy God he <i>is</i> God in heaven above, and on the earth beneath, and there is none else but he. 
40| And keep ye his commandments, and his ordinances, all that I command you this day; that it may be well with thee, and with thy sons after thee, that ye may be long-lived upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee for ever. 
41| Then Moses separated three cities beyond Jordan on the east, 
42| that the slayer might flee thither, who should have slain his neighbour unintentionally, and should not have hated him in times past, and he shall flee to one of these cities and live: 
43| Bosor in the wilderness, in the plain country of Ruben, and Ramoth in Galaad <i>belonging to</i> Gad, and Gaulon in Basan <i>belonging to</i> Manasse. 
44| This <i>is</i> the law which Moses set before the children of Israel. 
45| These <i>are</i> the testimonies, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt: 
46| on the other side of Jordan, in the valley near the house of Phogor, in the land of Seon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Esebon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel smote when they came out of the land of Egypt. 
47| And they inherited his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan eastward. 
48| From Aroer, which is on the border of the brook Arnon, even to the mount of Seon, which is Aermon. 
49| All Araba beyond Jordan eastward under Asedoth hewn in the rock.

1| And Moses called all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the ordinances and judgments, all that I speak in your ears this day, and ye shall learn them, and observe to do them. 
2| The Lord your God made a covenant with you in Choreb. 
3| The Lord did not make this covenant with your fathers, but with you: ye are all here alive this day. 
4| The Lord spoke to you face to face in the mountain out of the midst of the fire. 
5| And I stood between the Lord and you at that time to report to you the words of the Lord, (because ye were afraid before the fire, and ye went not up to the mountain) saying, 
6| I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.  
7| Thou shalt have no other gods before my face. 
8| Thou shalt not make to thyself an image, nor likeness of any thing, whatever things <i>are</i> in the heaven above, and whatever <i>are</i> in the earth beneath, and whatever <i>are</i> in the waters under the earth. 
9| Thou shalt not bow down to them, nor shalt thou serve them; for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, visiting the sins of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me, 
10| and doing mercifully to thousands of them that love me, and that keep my commandments. 
11| Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain, for the Lord thy God will certainly not acquit him that takes his name in vain.  
12| Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God commanded thee. 
13| Six days thou shalt work, and thou shalt do all thy works; 
14| but on the seventh day <i>is</i> the sabbath of the Lord thy God: thou shalt do in it no work, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, thine ox, and thine ass, and all thy cattle, and the stranger that sojourns in the midst of thee; that thy man-servant may rest, and thy maid, and thine ox, as well as thou. 
15| And thou shalt remember that thou wast a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out thence with a mighty hand, and a high arm: therefore the Lord appointed thee to keep the sabbath day and to sanctify it. 
16| Honour thy father and thy mother, as the Lord thy God commanded thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long upon the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee. 
17| Thou shalt not commit murder. 
18| Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
19| Thou shalt not steal. 
20| Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 
21| Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s wife; thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, nor his field, nor his man-servant, nor his maid, nor his ox, nor his ass, nor any beast of his, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s.  
22| These words the Lord spoke to all the assembly of you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire—<i>there was</i> darkness, blackness, storm, a loud voice—and he added no more, and he wrote them on two tables of stone, and he gave them to me. 
23| And it came to pass when ye heard the voice out of the midst of the fire, for the mountain burned with fire, that ye came to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders: 
24| and ye said, Behold, the Lord our God has shewn us his glory, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: this day we have seen that God shall speak to man, and he shall live. 
25| And now let us not die, for this great fire will consume us, if we shall hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, and we shall die. 
26| For what flesh <i>is there</i> which has heard the voice of the living God, speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we <i>have heard</i>, and shall live? 
27| Do thou draw near, and hear all that the Lord our God shall say, and thou shalt speak to us all things whatsoever the Lord our God shall speak to thee, and we will hear, and do.  
28| And the Lord heard the voice of your words as ye spoke to me; and the Lord said to me, I have heard the voice of the words of this people, even all things that they have said to thee. <i>They have</i> well <i>said</i> all that they have spoken. 
29| O that there were such a heart in them, that they should fear me and keep my commands always, that it might be well with them and with their sons for ever. 
30| Go, say to them, Return ye to your houses; 
31| but stand thou here with me, and I will tell thee all the commands, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which thou shalt teach them, and let them do so in the land which I give them for an inheritance. 
32| And ye shall take heed to do as the Lord thy God commanded thee; ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left, 
33| according to all the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in it, that he may give thee rest; and that it may be well with thee, and ye may prolong your days on the land which ye shall inherit.   

#6
1| And these <i>are</i> the commands, and the ordinances, and the judgments, as many as the Lord our God gave commandment to teach you to do so in the land on which ye enter to inherit it. 
2| That ye may fear the Lord your God, keep ye all his ordinances, and his commandments, which I command thee to-day, thou, and thy sons, and thy sons’ sons, all the days of thy life, that ye may live many days.  
3| Hear, therefore, O Israel, and observe to do them, that it may be well with thee, and that ye may be greatly multiplied, as the Lord God of thy fathers said that he would give thee a land flowing with milk and honey: and these <i>are</i> the ordinances, and the judgments, which the Lord commanded the children of Israel in the wilderness, when they had gone forth from the land of Egypt. 
4| Hear, O Israel, The Lord our God is one Lord. 
5| And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy mind, and with all thy soul, and all thy strength. 
6| And these words, all that I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart and in thy soul. 
7| And thou shalt teach them to thy children, and thou shalt speak of them sitting in the house, and walking by the way, and lying down, and rising up. 
8| And thou shalt fasten them for a sign upon thy hand, and it shall be immoveable before thine eyes. 
9| And ye shall write them on the lintels of your houses and of your gates.  
10| And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land which he sware to thy fathers, to Abraam, and to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and beautiful cities which thou didst not build, 
11| houses full of all good things which thou didst not fill, wells dug in the rock which thou didst not dig, vineyards and oliveyards which thou didst not plant, then having eaten and been filled, 
12| beware lest thou forget the Lord thy God that brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
13| Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve; and thou shalt cleave to him, and by his name thou shalt swear.  
14| Go ye not after other gods of the gods of the nations round about you; 
15| for the Lord thy God in the midst of thee <i>is</i> a jealous God, lest the Lord thy God be very angry with thee, and destroy thee from off the face of the earth.  
16| Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as ye tempted him in the temptation. 
17| Thou shalt by all means keep the commands of the Lord thy God, the testimonies, and the ordinances, which he commanded thee. 
18| And thou shalt do that which is pleasing and good before the Lord thy God, that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest go in and inherit the good land, which the Lord sware to your fathers, 
19| to chase all thine enemies from before thy face, as the Lord said.  
20| And it shall come to pass when thy son shall ask thee at a future time, saying, What are the testimonies, and the ordinances, and the judgments, which the Lord our God has commanded us? 
21| Then shalt thou say to thy son, We were slaves to Pharao in the land of Egypt, and the Lord brought us forth thence with a mighty hand, and with a high arm. 
22| And the Lord wrought signs and great and grievous wonders in Egypt, on Pharao and on his house before us. 
23| And he brought us out thence to give us this land, which he sware to give to our fathers. 
24| And the Lord charged us to observe all these ordinances; to fear the Lord our God, that it may be well with us for ever, that we may live, as even to-day. 
25| And there shall be mercy to us, if we take heed to keep all these commands before the Lord our God, as he has commanded us.

1| And when the Lord thy God shall bring thee into the land, into which thou goest to possess it, and shall remove great nations from before thee, the Chettite, and Gergesite, and Amorite, and Chananite, and Pherezite, and Evite, and Jebusite, seven nations <i>more</i> numerous and stronger than you, 
2| and the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy hands, then thou shalt smite them: thou shalt utterly destroy them: thou shalt not make a covenant with them, neither shall ye pity them: 
3| neither shall ye contract marriages with them: thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, and thou shalt not take his daughter to thy son. 
4| For he will draw away thy son from me, and he will serve other gods; and the Lord will be very angry with you, and will soon utterly destroy thee. 
5| But thus shall ye do to them; ye shall destroy their altars, and shall break down their pillars, and shall cut down their groves, and shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods. 
6| For thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God; and the Lord thy God chose thee to be to him a peculiar people beyond all nations that <i>are</i> upon the face of the earth.  
7| It was not because ye are more numerous than all <i>other</i> nations that the Lord preferred you, and the Lord made choice of you: for ye are fewer in number than all <i>other</i> nations. 
8| But because the Lord loved you, and as keeping the oath which he sware to your fathers, the Lord brought you out with a strong hand, and the Lord redeemed thee from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao king of Egypt. 
9| Thou shalt know therefore, that the Lord thy God, he <i>is</i> God, a faithful God, who keeps covenant and mercy for them that love him, and for those that keep his commandments to a thousand generations, 
10| and who recompenses them that hate him to their face, to destroy them utterly; and will not be slack with them that hate him: he will recompense them to their face.  
11| Thou shalt keep therefore the commands, and the ordinances, and these judgments, which I command thee this day to do. 
12| And it shall come to pass when ye shall have heard these ordinances, and shall have kept and done them, that the Lord thy God shall keep for thee the covenant and the mercy, which he sware to your fathers. 
13| And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee; and he will bless the off-spring of thy body, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep, on the land which the Lord sware to thy fathers to give to thee. 
14| Thou shalt be blessed beyond all nations; there shall not be among you an impotent or barren one, or among thy cattle. 
15| And the Lord thy God shall remove from thee all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou hast seen, and all that thou hast known, will he lay upon thee; but he will lay them upon all that hate thee.  
16| And thou shalt eat all the spoils of the nations which the Lord thy God gives thee; thine eye shall not spare them, and thou shalt not serve their gods; for this is an offence to thee.  
17| But if thou shouldest say in thine heart, This nation <i>is</i> greater than I, how shall I be able to destroy them utterly? 
18| thou shalt not fear them; thou shalt surely remember all that the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians: 
19| the great temptations which thine eyes have seen, those signs and great wonders, the strong hand, and the high arm; how the Lord thy God brought thee forth: so the Lord your God will do to all the nations, whom thou fearest in their presence. 
20| And the Lord thy God shall send against them the hornets, until they that are left and they that are hidden from thee be utterly destroyed. 
21| Thou shalt not be wounded before them, because the Lord thy God in the midst of thee <i>is</i> a great and powerful God. 
22| And the Lord thy God shall consume these nations before thee by little and little: thou shalt not be able to consume them speedily, lest the land become desert, and the wild beasts of the field be multiplied against thee. 
23| And the Lord thy God shall deliver them into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy them with a great destruction, until ye shall have utterly destroyed them. 
24| And he shall deliver their kings into your hands, and ye shall destroy their name from that place; none shall stand up in opposition before thee, until thou shalt have utterly destroyed them.  
25| Ye shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods: thou shalt not covet <i>their</i> silver, neither shalt thou take to thyself gold from them, lest thou shouldest offend thereby, because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God. 
26| And thou shalt not bring an abomination into thine house, so shouldest thou be an accursed thing like it; thou shalt utterly hate it, and altogether abominate it, because it is an accursed thing.   

#8
1| Ye shall observe to do all the commands which I charge you to-day, that ye may live and be multiplied, and enter in and inherit the land, which the Lord your God sware <i>to give</i> to your fathers. 
2| And thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God led thee in the wilderness, that he might afflict thee, and try thee, and that the things in thine heart might be made manifest, whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no. 
3| And he afflicted thee and straitened thee with hunger, and fed thee with manna, which thy fathers knew not; that he might teach thee that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God shall man live. 
4| Thy garments grew not old from off thee, thy shoes were not worn from off thee, thy feet were not <i>painfully</i> hardened, lo! these forty years.  
5| And thou shalt know in thine heart, that as if any man should chasten his son, so the Lord thy God will chasten thee. 
6| And thou shalt keep the commands of the Lord thy God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.  
7| For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good and extensive land, where there are torrents of waters, and fountains of deep places issuing through the plains and through the mountains: 
8| a land of wheat and barley, <i>wherein are</i> vines, figs, pomegranates; a land of olive oil and honey; 
9| a land on which thou shalt not eat thy bread with poverty, and thou shalt not want any thing upon it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of its mountains thou shalt dig brass. 
10| And thou shalt eat and be filled, and shalt bless the Lord thy God on the good land, which he has given thee. 
11| Take heed to thyself that thou forget not the Lord thy God, so as not to keep his commands, and his judgments, and ordinances, which I command thee this day: 
12| lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly houses, and dwelt in them; 
13| and thy oxen and thy sheep are multiplied to thee, and thy silver and thy gold are multiplied to thee, and all thy possessions are multiplied to thee, 
14| thou shouldest be exalted in heart, and forget the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: 
15| who brought thee through that great and terrible wilderness, where <i>is</i> the biting serpent, and scorpion, and drought, where there was no water; who brought thee a fountain of water out of the flinty rock: 
16| who fed thee with manna in the wilderness, which thou knewest not, and thy fathers knew not; that he might afflict thee, and thoroughly try thee, and do thee good in thy latter days. 
17| Lest thou shouldest say in thine heart, My strength, and the power of mine hand have wrought for me this great wealth. 
18| But thou shalt remember the Lord thy God, that he gives thee strength to get wealth; even that he may establish his covenant, which the Lord sware to thy fathers, as at this day.  
19| And it shall come to pass if thou do at all forget the Lord thy God, and shouldest go after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that ye shall surely perish. 
20| As also the other nations which the Lord God destroys before your face, so shall ye perish, because ye hearkened not to the voice of the Lord your God.   

#9
1| Hear, O Israel: Thou goest this day across Jordan to inherit nations greater and stronger than yourselves, cities great and walled up to heaven; 
2| a people great and many and tall, the sons of Enac, whom thou knowest, and concerning whom thou hast heard <i>say</i>, Who can stand before the children of Enac? 
3| And thou shalt know to-day, that the Lord thy God he shall go before thy face: he is a consuming fire; he shall destroy them, and he shall turn them back before thee, and shall destroy them quickly, as the Lord said to thee. 
4| Speak not in thine heart, when the Lord thy God has destroyed these nations before thy face, saying, For my righteousness the Lord brought me in to inherit this good land. 
5| Not for thy righteousness, nor for the holiness of thy heart, dost thou go in to inherit their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the Lord will destroy them from before thee, and that he may establish the covenant, which the Lord sware to our fathers, to Abraam, and to Isaac, and to Jacob.  
6| And thou shalt know to-day, that <i>it is</i> not for thy righteousnesses the Lord thy God gives thee this good land to inherit, for thou art a stiff-necked people. 
7| Remember, forget not, how much thou provokedst the Lord thy God in the wilderness: from the day that ye came forth out of Egypt, even till ye came into this place, ye continued to be disobedient toward the Lord.  
8| Also in Choreb ye provoked the Lord, and the Lord was angry with you to destroy you; 
9| when I went up into the mountain to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant, which the Lord made with you, and I was in the mountain forty days and forty nights, I ate no bread and drank no water. 
10| And the Lord gave me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and on them there had been written all the words which the Lord spoke to you in the mountain in the day of the assembly. 
11| And it came to pass after forty days and forty nights, the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant. 
12| And the Lord said to me, Arise, go down quickly from hence, for thy people whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt have transgressed; they have gone aside quickly out of the way which I commanded them, and have made themselves a molten image.  
13| And the Lord spoke to me, saying, I have spoken to thee once and again, saying, I have seen this people, and, behold, it is a stiff-necked people. 
14| And now suffer me utterly to destroy them, and I will blot out their name from under heaven, and will make of thee a nation great and strong, and more numerous than this. 
15| And I turned and went down from the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to heaven; and the two tables of the testimonies <i>were</i> in my two hands. 
16| And when I saw that ye had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made to yourselves a molten image, and had gone astray out of the way, which the Lord commanded you to keep; 
17| then I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before you. 
18| And I made my petition before the Lord as also at the first forty days and forty nights: I ate no bread and drank no water, on account of all your sins which ye sinned in doing evil before the Lord God to provoke him. 
19| And I was greatly terrified because of the wrath and anger, because the Lord was provoked with you utterly to destroy you; yet the Lord hearkened to me at this time also. 
20| And he was angry with Aaron to destroy him utterly, and I prayed for Aaron also at that time. 
21| And your sin which ye had made, <i>even</i> the calf, I took, and burnt it with fire, and pounded it and ground it down till it became fine; and it became like dust, and I cast the dust into the brook that descended from the mountain.  
22| Also in the burning, and in the temptation, and at the graves of lust, ye provoked the Lord. 
23| And when the Lord sent you forth from Cades Barne, saying, Go up and inherit the land which I give to you, then ye disobeyed the word of the Lord your God, and believed him not, and hearkened not to his voice. 
24| Ye were disobedient in the things relating to the Lord from the day in which he became known to you. 
25| And I prayed before the Lord forty days and forty nights, the number that I prayed <i>before</i>, for the Lord said that he would utterly destroy you. 
26| And I prayed to God, and said, O Lord, King of gods, destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, whom thou didst redeem, whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt with thy great power, and with thy strong hand, and with thy high arm. 
27| Remember Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob thy servants, to whom thou swarest by thyself: look not upon the hardness of heart of this people, and their impieties, and their sins. 
28| Lest the inhabitants of the land whence thou broughtest us out speak, saying, Because the Lord could not bring them into the land of which he spoke to them, and because he hated them, has he brought them forth to slay them in the wilderness. 
29| And these <i>are</i> thy people and thy portion, whom thou broughtest out of the land of Egypt with thy great strength, and with thy mighty hand, and with thy high arm. 0  

#10
1| At that time the Lord said to me, Hew for thyself two stone tables as the first, and come up to me into the mountain, and thou shalt make for thyself an ark of wood. 
2| And thou shalt write upon the tables the words which were on the first tables which thou didst break, and thou shalt put them into the ark. 
3| So I made an ark of boards of incorruptible wood, and I hewed tables of stone like the first, and I went up to the mountain, and the two tables were in my hand. 
4| And he wrote upon the tables according to the first writing the ten commandments, which the Lord spoke to you in the mountain out of the midst of the fire, and the Lord gave them to me. 
5| And I turned and came down from the mountain, and I put the tables into the ark which I had made; and there they were, as the Lord commanded me. 
6| And the children of Israel departed from Beeroth of the sons of Jakim <i>to</i> Misadai: there Aaron died, and there he was buried, and Eleazar his son was priest in his stead. 
7| Thence they departed to Gadgad; and from Gadgad to Etebatha, a land <i>wherein are</i> torrents of water.  
8| At that time the Lord separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, to stand near before the Lord, to minister and bless in his name to this day. 
9| Therefore the Levites have no part nor inheritance among their brethren; the Lord himself <i>is</i> their inheritance, as he said to them. 
10| And I remained in the mount forty days and forty nights: and the Lord heard me at that time also, and the Lord would not destroy you. 
11| And the Lord said to me, Go, set out before this people, and let them go in and inherit the land, which I sware to their fathers to give to them. 
12| And now, Israel, what does the Lord thy God require of thee, but to fear the Lord thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; 
13| to keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and his ordinances, all that I charge thee to-day, that it may be well with thee? 
14| Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens belong to the Lord thy God, the earth and all things that are in it. 
15| Only the Lord chose your fathers to love them, and he chose out their seed after them, <i>even</i> you, beyond all nations, as at this day. 
16| Therefore ye shall circumcise the hardness of your heart, and ye shall not harden your neck. 
17| For the Lord your God, he <i>is</i> God of gods, and the Lord of lords, the great, and strong, and terrible God, who does not accept persons, nor will he by any means accept a bribe: 
18| executing judgment for the stranger and orphan and widow, and he loves the stranger to give him food and raiment. 
19| And ye shall love the stranger; for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt.  
20| Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him, and shalt cleave to him, and shalt swear by his name. 
21| He <i>is</i> thy boast, and he <i>is</i> thy God, who has wrought in the midst of thee these great and glorious things, which thine eyes have seen. 
22| With seventy souls your fathers went down into Egypt; but the Lord thy God has made thee as the stars of heaven in multitude. 1  

#11
1| Therefore thou shalt love the Lord thy God, and shalt observe his appointments, and his ordinances, and his commandments, and his judgments, always. 
2| And ye shall know this day; for <i>I speak</i> not to your children, who know not and have not seen the discipline of the Lord thy God, and his wonderful works, and his strong hand, and his high arm, 
3| and his miracles, and his wonders, which he wrought in the midst of Egypt on Pharao king of Egypt, and all his land; 
4| and what he did to the host of the Egyptians, and to their chariots, and their cavalry, and their host; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overwhelm the face of them as they pursued after you, and the Lord destroyed them until this day; 
5| and all the things which he did to you in the wilderness until ye came into this place; 
6| and all the things that he did to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab the son of Ruben, whom the earth opening her mouth swallowed up, and their houses, and their tents, and all their substance that was with them, in the midst of all Israel: 
7| for your eyes have seen all the mighty works of the Lord, which he wrought among you to-day. 
8| And ye shall keep all his commandments, as many as I command thee to-day, that ye may live, and be multiplied, and that ye may go in and inherit the land, into which ye go across Jordan to inherit it: 
9| that ye may live long upon the land, which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and to their seed after them, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
10| For the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is not as the land of Egypt, whence ye came out, whensoever they sow the seed, and water it with their feet, as a garden of herbs: 
11| but the land into which thou goest to inherit it, is a land of mountains and plains; it shall drink water of the rain of heaven. 
12| A land which the Lord thy God surveys continually, the eyes of the Lord thy God are upon it from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.  
13| Now if ye will indeed hearken to all the commands which I charge thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, and to serve him with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, 
14| then he shall give to thy land the early and latter rain in its season, and thou shalt bring in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. 
15| And he shall give food in thy fields to thy cattle; and when thou hast eaten and art full, 
16| take heed to thyself that thy heart be not puffed up, and ye transgress, and serve other gods, and worship them: 
17| and the Lord be angry with you, and restrain the heaven; and there shall not be rain, and the earth shall not yield its fruit, and ye shall perish quickly from off the good land, which the Lord has given you. 
18| And ye shall store these words in your heart and in your soul, and ye shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and it shall be fixed before your eyes. 
19| And ye shall teach them to your children, so as to speak about them when thou sittest in the house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou sleepest, and when thou risest up. 
20| And ye shall write them on the lintels of your houses, and on your gates; 
21| that your days may be long, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, as the days of heaven upon the earth. 
22| And it shall come to pass that if ye will indeed hearken to all these commands, which I charge thee to observe this day, to love the Lord our God, and to walk in all his ways, and to cleave close to him; 
23| then the Lord shall cast out all these nations before you, and ye shall inherit great nations and stronger than yourselves. 
24| Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be your; from the wilderness and Antilibanus, and from the great river, the river Euphrates, even as far as the west sea shall be your coasts. 
25| No one shall stand before you; and the Lord your God will put the fear of you and the dread of you on the face of all the land, on which ye shall tread, as he told you. 
26| Behold, I set before you this day the blessing and the curse; 
27| the blessing, if ye hearken to the commands of the Lord your God, all that I command you this day; 
28| and the curse, if ye do not hearken to the commands of the Lord our God, as many as I command you this day, and ye wander from the way which I have commanded you, having gone to serve other gods, which ye know not. 
29| And it shall come to pass when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land into which thou goest over to inherit it, then thou shalt put blessing on mount Garizin, and the curse upon mount Gaebal. 
30| Lo! are not these beyond Jordan, behind, westward in the land of Chanaan, which lies westward near Golgol, by the high oak? 
31| For ye are passing over Jordan, to go in and inherit the land, which the Lord our God gives you to inherit always, and ye shall dwell in it.  
32| And ye shall take heed to do all his ordinances, and these judgments, as many as I set before you to-day. 2  

#12
1| And these <i>are</i> the ordinances and the judgments, which ye shall observe to do in the land, which the Lord God of your fathers gives you for an inheritance, all the days which ye live upon the land. 
2| Ye shall utterly destroy all the places in which they served their gods, whose <i>land</i> ye inherit, on the high mountains and on the hills, and under the thick tree. 
3| And ye shall destroy their altars, and break in pieces their pillars, and ye shall cut down their groves, and ye shall burn with fire the graven images of their gods, and ye shall abolish their name out of that place. 
4| Ye shall not do so to the Lord your God. 
5| But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose in one of your cities to name his name there, and to be called upon, ye shall even seek <i>him</i> out and go thither. 
6| And ye shall carry thither your whole-burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your first-fruits, and your vowed-offerings, and your freewill-offerings, and your offerings of thanksgiving, the first-born of your herds, and of your flocks. 
7| And ye shall eat there before the Lord your God, and ye shall rejoice in all the things on which ye shall lay your hand, ye and your houses, as the Lord your God has blessed you.  
8| Ye shall not do altogether as we do here to-day, every man that which is pleasing in his own sight. 
9| For hitherto ye have not arrived at the rest and the inheritance, which the Lord our God gives you. 
10| And ye shall go over Jordan, and shall dwell in the land, which the Lord our God takes as an inheritance for you; and he shall give you rest from all your enemies round about, and ye shall dwell safely. 
11| And there shall be a place which the Lord thy God shall choose for his name to be called there, thither shall ye bring all things that I order you to-day; your whole-burnt-offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the first-fruits of your hands, and every choice gift of yours, whatsoever ye shall vow to the Lord your God. 
12| And ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye and your sons, and your daughters, and your men-servants and your maid-servants, and the Levite that is at your gates; because he has no portion or inheritance with you. 
13| Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy whole-burnt-offerings in any place which thou shalt see; 
14| save in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, in one of thy tribes, there shall ye offer your whole-burnt-offerings, and there shalt thou do all things whatsoever I charge thee this day. 
15| But thou shalt kill according to all thy desire, and shalt eat flesh according to the blessing of the Lord thy God, which he has given thee in every city; the unclean that is within thee and the clean shall eat it on equal terms, as the doe or the stag. 
16| Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it out on the ground as water.  
17| Thou shalt not be able to eat in thy cities the tithe of thy corn, and of thy wine, and of thine oil, the first-born of thine herd and of thy flock, and all <i>your</i> vows as many as ye shall have vowed, and your thank-offerings, and the first-fruits of thine hands. 
18| But before the Lord thy God thou shalt eat it, in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the stranger that is within thy gates; and thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, on whatsoever thou shalt lay thine hand.  
19| Take heed to thyself that thou do not desert the Levite all the time that thou livest upon the earth. 
20| And if the Lord thy God shall enlarge thy borders, as he said to thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh; if thy soul should desire to eat flesh, thou shalt eat flesh according to all the desire of thy soul. 
21| And if the place be far from thee, which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself, that his name be called upon it, then thou shalt kill of thy herd and of thy flock which God shall have given thee, even as I commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy cities according to the desire of thy soul. 
22| As the doe and the stag are eaten, so shalt thou eat it; the unclean in thee and the clean shall eat it in like manner. 
23| Take diligent heed that thou eat no blood, for blood <i>is</i> the life of it; the life shall not be eaten with the flesh. 
24| Ye shall not eat <i>it</i>; ye shall pour it out on the ground as water. 
25| Thou shalt not eat it, that it may be well with thee and with thy sons after thee, if thou shalt do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord thy God. 
26| But thou shalt take thy holy things, if thou hast any, and thy vowed-offerings, and come to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name named upon it. 
27| And thou shalt sacrifice thy whole-burnt-offerings, thou shalt offer the flesh upon the altar of the Lord thy God; but the blood of thy sacrifices thou shalt pour out at the foot of the altar of the Lord thy God, but the flesh thou shalt eat. 
28| Beware and hearken, and thou shalt do all the commands which I charge thee, that it may be well with thee and with thy sons for ever, if thou shalt do that which is pleasing and good before the Lord thy God.  
29| And if the Lord thy God shall utterly destroy the nations, to whom thou goest in thither to inherit their land, from before thee, and thou shalt inherit it, and dwell in their land; 
30| take heed to thyself that thou seek not to follow them after they are destroyed before thee, saying, How do these nations act towards their gods? I will do likewise. 
31| Thou shalt not do so to thy God; for they have sacrificed to their gods the abominations of the Lord which he hates, for they burn their sons and their daughters in fire to their gods. 
32| Every word that I command you this day, it shalt thou observe to do: thou shalt not add to it, nor diminish from it. 3

1| And if there arise within thee a prophet, or one who dreams a dream, and he gives thee a sign or a wonder, 
2| and the sign or the wonder come to pass which he spoke to thee, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which ye know not; 
3| ye shall not hearken to the words of that prophet, or the dreamer of that dream, because the Lord thy God tries you, to know whether ye love your God with all your heart and with all your soul. 
4| Ye shall follow the Lord your God, and fear him, and ye shall hear his voice, and attach yourselves to him. 
5| And that prophet or that dreamer of a dream, shall die; for he has spoken to make thee err from the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, who redeemed thee from bondage, to thrust thee out of the way which the Lord thy God commanded thee to walk in: so shalt thou abolish the evil from among you. 
6| And if thy brother by thy father or mother, or thy son, or daughter, or thy wife in thy bosom, or friend who is equal to thine own soul, entreat thee secretly, saying, Let us go and serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, 
7| of the gods of the nations that are round about you, who are near thee or at a distance from thee, from one end of the earth to the other; 
8| thou shalt not consent to him, neither shalt thou hearken to him; and thine eye shall not spare him, thou shalt feel no regret for him, neither shalt thou at all protect him: 
9| thou shalt surely report concerning him, and thy hands shall be upon him among the first to slay him, and the hands of all the people at the last. 
10| And they shall stone him with stones, and he shall die, because he sought to draw thee away from the Lord thy God who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. 
11| And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall not again do according to this evil thing among you. 
12| And if in one of thy cities which the Lord God gives thee to dwell therein, thou shalt hear men saying, 
13| Evil men have gone out from you, and have caused all the inhabitants of their land to fall away, saying, Let us go and worship other gods, whom ye knew not, 
14| then thou shalt enquire and ask, and search diligently, and behold, <i>if</i> the thing is clearly true, and this abomination has taken place among you, 
15| thou shalt utterly destroy all the dwellers in that land with the edge of the sword; ye shall solemnly curse it, and all things in it. 
16| And all its spoils thou shalt gather into its public ways, and thou shalt burn the city with fire, and all its spoils publicly before the Lord thy God; and it shall be uninhabited for ever, it shall not be built again. 
17| And there shall nothing of the cursed thing cleave to thy hand, that the Lord may turn from his fierce anger, and shew thee mercy, and pity thee, and multiply thee, as he sware to thy fathers; 
18| if thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments, all that I charge thee this day, to do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord thy God. 4

1| Ye are the children of the Lord your God: ye shall not make any baldness between you eyes for the dead. 
2| For thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God, and the Lord thy God has chosen thee to be a peculiar people to himself of all the nations on the face of the earth. 
3| Ye shall not eat any abominable thing. 
4| These <i>are</i> the beasts which ye shall eat; the calf of the herd, and lamb of the sheep, and kid of the goats; 
5| the stag, and doe, and pygarg, and wild goat, and camelopard. 
6| Every beast that divides the hoofs, and makes claws of two divisions, and that chews the cud among beasts, these ye shall eat. 
7| And these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud, and of those that divide the hoofs, and make distinct claws; the camel, and the hare, and the rabbit; because they chew the cud, and do not divide the hoof, these are unclean to you. 
8| And as for the swine, because he divides the hoof, and makes claws of the hoof, yet he chews not the cud, he is unclean to you; ye shall not eat of their flesh, ye shall not touch their dead bodies.  
9| And these ye shall eat of all that are in the water, ye shall eat all that have fins and scales. 
10| And all that have not fins and scales ye shall not eat; they are unclean to you. 
11| Ye shall eat every clean bird. 
12| And these of them ye shall not eat; the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the sea-eagle, 
13| and the vulture, and the kite and the like to it, 
14 15| and the sparrow, and the owl, and the seamew, 
16| and the heron, and the swan, and the stork, 
17| and the cormorant, and the hawk, and its like, and the hoopoe, and the raven, 
18| and the pelican, and the diver and the like to it, and the red-bill and the bat. 
19| All winged animals that creep are unclean to you; ye shall not eat of them. 
20| Ye shall eat every clean bird. 
21| Ye shall eat nothing that dies of itself; it shall be given to the sojourner in thy cities and he shall eat it, or thou shalt sell it to a stranger, because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God. Thou shalt not boil a lamb in his mother’s milk. 
22| Thou shalt tithe a tenth of all the produce of thy seed, the fruit of thy field year by year. 
23| And thou shalt eat it in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called there; ye shall bring the tithe of thy corn and of thy wine, and of thine oil, the first-born of thy herd and of thy flock, that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always. 
24| And if the journey be too far for thee, and thou art not able to bring them, because the place <i>is</i> far from thee which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called there, because the Lord thy God will bless thee; 
25| then thou shalt sell them for money, and thou shalt take the money in thy hands, and thou shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose. 
26| And thou shalt give the money for whatsoever thy soul shall desire, for oxen or for sheep, or for wine, or <i>thou shalt lay it out</i> on strong drink, or on whatsoever thy soul may desire, and thou shalt eat there before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt rejoice and thy house, 
27| and the Levite that is in thy cities, because he has not a portion or inheritance with thee.  
28| After three years thou shalt bring out all the tithes of thy fruits, in that year thou shalt lay it up in thy cities. 
29| And the Levite shall come, because he has no part or lot with thee, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which is in thy cities; and they shall eat and be filled, that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works which thou shalt do. 5  

#15
1| Every seven years thou shalt make a release. 
2| And this <i>is</i> the ordinance of the release: thou shalt remit every private debt which thy neighbour owes thee, and thou shalt not ask payment of it from thy brother; for it has been called a release to the Lord thy God. 
3| Of a stranger thou shalt ask again whatsoever he has of thine, but to thy brother thou shalt remit his debt to thee. 
4| For <i>thus</i> there shall not be a poor person in the midst of thee, for the Lord thy God will surely bless thee in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee by inheritance, that thou shouldest inherit it.  
5| And if ye shall indeed hearken to the voice of the Lord your God, to keep and do all these commandments, as many as I charge thee this day, 
6| (for the Lord thy God has blessed thee in the way of which he spoke to thee,)then thou shalt lend to many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee.  
7| And if there shall be in the midst of thee a poor <i>man</i> of thy brethren in one of thy cities in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, neither shalt thou by any means close up thine hand from thy brother who is in want. 
8| Thou shalt surely open thine hands to him, and shalt lend to him as much as he wants according to his need. 
9| Take heed to thyself that there be not a secret thing in thine heart, an iniquity, saying, The seventh year, the year of release, draws nigh; and thine eye shall be evil to thy brother that is in want, and thou shalt not give to him, and he shall cry against thee to the Lord, and there shall be great sin in thee. 
10| Thou shalt surely give to him, and thou shalt lend him as much as he wants, according as he is in need; and thou shalt not grudge in thine heart as thou givest to him, because on this account the Lord thy God will bless thee in all thy works, and in all things on which thou shalt lay thine hand. 
11| For the poor shall not fail off thy land, therefore I charge thee to do this thing, saying, Thou shalt surely open thine hands to thy poor brother, and to him that is distressed upon thy land. 
12| And if thy brother <i>or sister</i>, a Hebrew man or a Hebrew woman, be sold to thee, he shall serve thee six years, and in the seventh year thou shalt send him out free from thee. 
13| And when thou shalt send him out free from thee, thou shalt not send him out empty. 
14| Thou shalt give him provision for the way from thy flock, and from thy corn, and from thy wine; as the Lord thy God has blessed thee, thou shalt give to him.  
15| And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee from thence; therefore I charge thee to do this thing. 
16| And if he should say to thee, I will not go out from thee, because he continues to love thee and thy house, because he is well with thee; 
17| then thou shalt take an awl, and bore his ear through to the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever; and in like manner shalt thou do to thy maid-servant. 
18| It shall not seem hard to thee when they are sent out free from thee, because <i>thy servant</i> has served thee six years according to the annual hire of a hireling; so the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all things whatsoever thou mayest do. 
19| Every first-born that shall be born among thy kine and thy sheep, thou shalt sanctify the males to the Lord thy God; thou shalt not work with thy first-born calf, and thou shalt not shear the first-born of thy sheep. 
20| Thou shalt eat it before the Lord year by year in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, thou and thy house. 
21| And if there be in it a blemish, if it be lame or blind, an evil blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it to the Lord thy God.  
22| Thou shalt eat it in thy cities; the unclean in thee and the clean shall eat it in like manner, as the doe or the stag. 
23| Only ye shall not eat the blood; thou shalt pour it out on the earth as water. 6  

#16
1| Observe the month of new <i>corn</i>, and thou shalt sacrifice the passover to the Lord thy God; because in the month of new corn thou camest out of Egypt by night. 
2| And thou shalt sacrifice the passover to the Lord thy God, sheep and oxen in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called upon it. 
3| Thou shalt not eat leaven with it; seven days shalt thou eat unleavened <i>bread</i> with it, bread of affliction, because ye came forth out of Egypt in haste; that ye may remember the day of your coming forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of your life. 
4| Leaven shall not be seen with thee in all thy borders for seven days, and there shall not be left of the flesh which thou shalt sacrifice at even on the first day until the morning. 
5| thou shalt not have power to sacrifice the passover in any of the cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee. 
6| But in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, to have his name called there, thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even at the setting of the sun, at the time when thou camest out of Egypt. 
7| And thou shalt boil and roast and eat it in the place, which the Lord thy God shall choose; and thou shalt return in the morning, and go to thy house. 
8| Six days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day is a holiday, a feast to the Lord thy God: thou shalt not do in it any work, save what must be done by any one.  
9| Seven weeks shalt thou number to thyself; when thou hast begun <i>to put</i> the sickle to the corn, thou shalt begin to number seven weeks. 
10| And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks to the Lord thy God, accordingly as thy hand has power in as many things as the Lord thy God shall give thee. 
11| And thou shalt rejoice before the Lord thy God, thou and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow which dwells among you, in whatsoever place the Lord thy God shall choose, that his name should be called there.  
12| And thou shalt remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt, and thou shalt observe and do these commands. 
13| Thou shalt keep for thyself the feast of tabernacles seven days, when thou gatherest in <i>thy produce</i> from thy corn-floor and thy wine-press. 
14| And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and thy daughter, thy man-servant, and thy maid-servant, and the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow that is in thy cities. 
15| Seven days shalt thou keep a feast to the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord thy God shall choose for himself; and if the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all thy fruits, and in every work of thy hands, then thou shalt rejoice.  
16| Three times in the year shall all thy males appear before the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose in the feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the feast of tabernacles: thou shalt not appear before the Lord thy God empty. 
17| Each one according to his ability, according to the blessing of the Lord thy God which he has given thee. 
18| Thou shalt make for thyself judges and officers in thy cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee in <i>thy</i> tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment: 
19| they shall not wrest judgment, nor favour persons, nor receive a gift; for gifts blind the eyes of the wise, and pervert the words of the righteous. 
20| Thou shalt justly pursue justice, that ye may live, and go in and inherit the land which the Lord thy God gives thee.  
21| Thou shalt not plant for thyself a grove; thou shalt not plant for thyself any tree near the altar of thy God. 
22| Thou shalt not set up for thyself a pillar, which the Lord thy God hates. 7  

#17
1| Thou shalt not sacrifice to the Lord thy God a calf or a sheep, in which there is a blemish, <i>or</i> any evil thing; for it is an abomination to the Lord thy God.  
2| And if there should be found in any one of thy cities, which the Lord thy God gives thee, a man or a woman who shall do that which is evil before the Lord thy God, so as to transgress his covenant, 
3| and they should go and serve other gods, and worship them, the sun, or the moon, or any of the host of heaven, which he commanded thee not to do, 
4| and it be told thee, and thou shalt have enquired diligently, and, behold, the thing really took place, this abomination has been done in Israel; 
5| then shalt thou bring out that man, or that woman, and ye shall stone them with stones, and they shall die. 
6| He shall die on the testimony of two or three witnesses; a man who is put to death shall not be put to death for one witness. 
7| And the hand of the witnesses shall be upon him among the first to put him to death, and the hand of the people at the last; so shalt thou remove the evil one from among yourselves. 
8| And if a matter shall be too hard for thee in judgment, between blood and blood, and between cause and cause, and between stroke and stroke, and between contradiction and contradiction, matters of judgment in your cities; 
9| then thou shalt arise and go up to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt come to the priests the Levites, and to the judge who shall be in those days, and they shall search out <i>the matter</i> and report the judgment to thee. 
10| And thou shalt act according to the thing which they shall report to thee out of the place which the Lord thy God shall choose, and thou shalt observe to do all whatsoever shall have been by law appointed to thee. 
11| Thou shalt do according to the law and to the judgment which they shall declare to thee: thou shalt not swerve to the right hand or to the left from any sentence which they shall report to thee.  
12| And the man whosoever shall act in haughtiness, so as not to hearken to the priest who stands to minister in the name of the Lord thy God, or the judge who shall preside in those days, that man shall die, and thou shalt remove the evil one out of Israel. 
13| And all the people shall hear and fear, and shall no more commit impiety. 
14| And when thou shalt enter into the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, and shalt inherit it and dwell in it, and shalt say, I will set a ruler over me, as also the other nations round about me; 
15| thou shalt surely set over thee the ruler whom the Lord God shall choose: of thy brethren thou shalt set over thee a ruler; thou shalt not have power to set over thee a stranger, because he is not thy brother. 
16| For he shall not multiply to himself horses, and he shall by no means turn the people back to Egypt, lest he should multiply to himself horses; for the Lord said, Ye shall not any more turn back by that way. 
17| And he shall not multiply to himself wives, lest his heart turn away; and he shall not greatly multiply to himself silver and gold.  
18| And when he shall be established in his government, then shall he write for himself this repetition of the law into a book by the hands of the priests the Levites; 
19| and it shall be with him, and he shall read in it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord thy God, and to keep all these commandments, and to observe these ordinances: 
20| that his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, that he depart not from the commandments on the right hand or on the left; that he and his sons may reign long in his dominion among the children of Israel. 8  

#18
1| The priests, the Levites, even the whole tribe of Levi, shall have no part nor inheritance with Israel; the burnt-offerings of the Lord <i>are</i> their inheritance, they shall eat them. 
2| And they shall have no inheritance among their brethren; the Lord himself <i>is</i> his portion, as he said to him. 
3| And this <i>is</i> the due of the priests in the things coming from the people from those who offer sacrifices, whether it be a calf or a sheep; and thou shalt give the shoulder to the priest, and the cheeks, and the great intestine: 
4| and the first-fruits of thy corn, and of thy wine, and of thine oil; and thou shalt give to him the first-fruits of the fleeces of thy sheep: 
5| because the Lord has chosen him out of all thy tribes, to stand before the Lord thy God, to minister and bless in his name, himself and his sons among the children of Israel.  
6| And if a Levite come from one of the cities of all the children of Israel, where he himself dwells, accordingly as his mind desires, to the place which he shall have chosen, 
7| he shall minister to the name of the Lord his God, as all his brethren the Levites, who stand there present before the Lord thy God. 
8| He shall eat an allotted portion, besides the sale of his hereditary property. 
9| And when thou shalt have entered into the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, thou shalt not learn to do according to the abominations of those nations.  
10| There shall not be found in thee one who purges his son or his daughter with fire, one who uses divination, who deals with omens, and augury, 
11| a sorcerer employing incantation, one who has in him a divining spirit, and observer of signs, questioning the dead. 
12| For every one that does these things is an abomination to the Lord thy God; for because of these abominations the Lord will destroy them from before thy face. 
13| Thou shalt be perfect before the Lord thy God. 
14| For all these nations whose <i>land</i> thou shalt inherit, they will listen to omens and divinations; but the Lord thy God has not permitted thee so <i>to do</i>. 
15| The Lord thy God shall raise up to thee a prophet of thy brethren, like me; him shall ye hear: 
16| according to all things which thou didst desire of the Lord thy God in Choreb in the day of the assembly, saying, We will not again hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and we will not any more see this great fire, and <i>so</i> we shall not die. 
17| And the Lord said to me, They have spoken rightly all that they have said to thee. 
18| I will raise up to them a prophet of their brethren, like thee; and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them as I shall command him. 
19| And whatever man shall not hearken to whatsoever words that prophet shall speak in my name, I will take vengeance on him. 
20| But the prophet whosoever shall impiously speak in my name a word which I have not commanded him to speak, and whosoever shall speak in the name of other gods, that prophet shall die. 
21| But if thou shalt say in thine heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord has not spoken? 
22| Whatsoever words that prophet shall speak in the name of the Lord, and they shall not come true, and not come to pass, this <i>is</i> the thing which the Lord has not spoken; that prophet has spoken wickedly: ye shall not spare him. 9  

#19
1| And when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed the nations, which God gives thee, <i>even</i> the land, and ye shall inherit them, and dwell in their cities, and in their houses, 
2| thou shalt separate for thyself three cities in the midst of thy land, which the Lord thy God gives thee. 
3| Take a survey of thy way, and thou shalt divide the coasts of thy land, which the Lord thy God apportions to thee, into three parts, and there shall be there a refuge for every manslayer.  
4| And this shall be the ordinance of the manslayer, who shall flee thither, and shall live, whosoever shall have smitten his neighbour ignorantly, whereas he hated him not in times past. 
5| And whosoever shall enter with his neighbour into the thicket, to gather wood, if the hand of him that cuts wood with the axe should be violently shaken, and the axe head falling off from the handle should light on his neighbour, and he should die, he shall flee to one of these cities, and live. 
6| Lest the avenger of blood pursue after the slayer, because his heart is hot, and overtake him, if the way be too long, and slay him, though there is to this man no sentence of death, because he hated him not in time past. 
7| Therefore I charge thee, saying, Thou shalt separate for thy self three cities.  
8| And if the Lord shall enlarge thy borders, as he sware to thy fathers, and the Lord shall give to thee all the land which he said he would give to thy fathers; 
9| if thou shalt hearken to do all these commands, which I charge thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways continually; thou shalt add for thyself yet three cities to these three. 
10| So innocent blood shall not be spilt in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit, and there shall not be in thee one guilty of blood.  
11| But if there should be in thee a man hating his neighbour, and he should lay wait for him, and rise up against him, and smite him, that he die, and he should flee to one of these cities, 
12| then shall the elders of his city send, and take him thence, and they shall deliver him into the hands of the avengers of blood, and he shall die. 
13| Thine eye shall not spare him; so shalt thou purge innocent blood from Israel, and it shall be well with thee. 
14| Thou shalt not move the landmarks of thy neighbour, which thy fathers set in the inheritance, in which thou hast obtained a share in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit. 
15| One witness shall not stand to testify against a man for any iniquity, or for any fault, or for any sin which he may commit; by the mouth of two witnesses, or by the mouth of three witnesses, shall every word be established. 
16| And if an unjust witness rise up against a man, alleging iniquity against him; 
17| then shall the two men between whom the controversy is, stand before the Lord, and before the priests, and before the judges, who may be in those days. 
18| And the judges shall make diligent inquiry, and, behold, <i>if</i> and unjust witness has borne unjust testimony; <i>and</i> has stood up against his brother; 
19| then shall ye do to him as he wickedly devised to do against his brother, and thou shalt remove the evil from yourselves. 
20| And the rest shall hear and fear, and do no more according to this evil thing in the midst of you. 
21| Thine eye shall not spare him: <i>thou shalt exact</i> life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot. 0  

#20
1| And if thou shouldest go forth to war against thine enemies, and shouldest see horse, and rider, and a people more numerous than thyself; thou shalt not be afraid of them, for the Lord thy God <i>is</i> with thee, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt. 
2| And it shall come to pass whenever thou shalt draw nigh to battle, that the priest shall draw nigh and speak to the people, and shall say to them, 
3| Hear, O Israel; ye are going this day to battle against your enemies: let not your heart faint, fear not, neither be confounded, neither turn aside from their face. 
4| For <i>it is</i> the Lord your God who advances with you, to fight with you against your enemies, <i>and</i> to save you.  
5| And the scribes shall speak to the people, saying, What man <i>is</i> he that has built a new house, and has not dedicated it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the war, and another man dedicate it. 
6| And what man <i>is</i> he that has planted a vineyard, and not been made merry with it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man be made merry with it. 
7| And what man <i>is</i> he that has betrothed a wife, and has not taken her? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the battle, and another man take her. 
8| And the scribes shall speak further to the people, and say, What man <i>is</i> he that fears and is cowardly in his heart? Let him go and return to his house, lest he make the heart of his brother fail, as his own. 
9| And it shall come to pass when the scribes shall have ceased speaking to the people, that they shall appoint generals of the army to be leaders of the people. 
10| And if thou shalt draw nigh to a city to overcome them by war, then call them out peaceably. 
11| If then they should answer peaceably to thee, and open to thee, it shall be that all the people found in it shall be tributary and subject to thee. 
12| But if they will not hearken to thee, but wage war against thee, thou shalt invest it; 
13| until the Lord thy God shall deliver it into thy hands, and thou shalt smite every male of it with the edge of the sword: 
14| except the women and the stuff: and all the cattle, and whatsoever shall be in the city, and all the plunder thou shalt take as spoil for thyself, and shalt eat all the plunder of thine enemies whom the Lord thy God gives thee. 
15| Thus shalt thou do to all the cities that are very far off from thee, not <i>being</i> of the cities of these nations which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit their land. 
16| <i>Of these</i> ye shall not take any thing alive; 
17| but ye shall surely curse them, the Chettite, and the Amorite, and the Chananite, and the Pherezite, and the Evite, and the Jebusite, and the Gergesite; as the Lord thy God commanded thee: 
18| that they may not teach you to do all their abominations, which they did to their gods, and <i>so</i> ye should sin before the Lord your God.  
19| And if thou shouldest besiege a city many days to prevail against it by war to take it, thou shalt not destroy its trees, by applying an iron tool to them, but thou shalt eat of it, and shalt not cut it down: Is the tree that is in the field a man, to enter before thee into the work of the siege? 
20| But the tree which thou knowest to be not fruit-bearing, this thou shalt destroy and cut down; and thou shalt construct a mound against the city, which makes war against thee, until it be delivered up. 1  

#21
1| And if one be found slain with the sword in the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit, having fallen in the field, and they do not know who has smitten <i>him</i>; 
2| thine elders and thy judges shall come forth, and shall measure the distances of the cities round about the slain man: 
3| and it shall be that the city which is nearest to the slain man the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which has not laboured, and which has not borne a yoke. 
4| And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer into a rough valley, which has not been tilled and is not sown, and they shall slay the heifer in the valley. 
5| And the priests the Levites shall come, because the Lord God has chosen them to stand by him, and to bless in his name, and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be <i>decided</i>. 
6| And all the elders of that city who draw nigh to the slain man shall wash their hands over the head of the heifer which was slain in the valley; 
7| and they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this blood, and our eyes have not seen <i>it</i>. 
8| Be merciful to thy people Israel, whom thou hast redeemed, O Lord, that innocent blood may not be charged on thy people Israel: and the blood shall be atoned for to them. 
9| And thou shalt take away innocent blood from among you, if thou shouldest do that which is good and pleasing before the Lord thy God. 
10| And if when thou goest out to war against thine enemies, the Lord thy God should deliver them into thine hands, and thou shouldest take their spoil, 
11| and shouldest see among the spoil a woman beautiful in countenance, and shouldest desire her, and take her to thyself for a wife, 
12| and shouldest bring her within thine house: then shalt thou shave her head, and pare her nails; 
13| and shalt take away her garments of captivity from off her, and she shall abide in thine house, and shall bewail her father and mother the days of a month; and afterwards thou shalt go in to her and dwell with her, and she shall be thy wife.  
14| And it shall be if thou do not delight in her, thou shalt send her out free; and she shall not by any means be sold for money, thou shalt not treat her contemptuously, because thou hast humbled her. 
15| And if a man have two wives, the one loved and the other hated, and both the loved and the hated should have born him <i>children</i>, and the son of the hated should be first-born; 
16| then it shall be that whensoever he shall divide by inheritance his goods to his sons, he shall not be able to give the right of the first-born to the son of the loved one, having overlooked the son of the hated, which is the first-born. 
17| But he shall acknowledge the first-born of the hated one to give to him double of all things which shall be found by him, because he is the first of his children, and to him belongs the birthright. 
18| And if any man has a disobedient and contentious son, who hearkens not to the voice of his father and the voice of his mother, and they should correct him, and he should not hearken to them; 
19| then shall his father and his mother take hold of him, and bring him forth to the elders of his city, and to the gate of the place: 
20| and they shall say to the men of their city, This our son is disobedient and contentious, he hearkens not to our voice, he is a reveler and a drunkard. 
21| And the men of his city shall stone him with stones, and he shall die; and thou shalt remove the evil one from yourselves, and the rest shall hear and fear.  
22| And if there be sin in any one, <i>and</i> the judgment of death <i>be upon him</i>, and he be put to death, and ye hang him on a tree: 
23| his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but ye shall by all means bury it in that day; for every one that is hanged on a tree is cursed of God; and ye shall by no means defile the land which the Lord thy God gives thee for an inheritance. 2

1| When thou seest the calf of thy brother or his sheep wandering in the way, thou shalt not overlook them; thou shalt by all means turn them back to thy brother, and thou shalt restore them to him. 
2| And if thy brother do not come nigh thee, and thou dost not know him, thou shalt bring it into thy house within; and it shall be with thee until thy brother shall seek them, and thou shalt restore them to him. 
3| Thus shalt thou do to his ass, and thus shalt thou do to his garment, and thus shalt thou do to every thing that thy brother has lost; whatsoever shall have been lost by him, and thou shalt have found, thou shalt not have power to overlook. 
4| Thou shalt not see the ass of thy brother, or his calf, fallen in the way: thou shalt not overlook them, thou shalt surely help him to raise them up. 
5| The apparel of a man shall not be on a woman, neither shall a man put on a woman’s dress; for every one that does these things is an abomination to the Lord thy God. 
6| And if thou shouldest come upon a brood of birds before thy face in the way or upon any tree, or upon the earth, young or eggs, and the mother be brooding on the young or the eggs, thou shalt not take the dam with the young ones. 
7| Thou shalt by all means let the mother go, but thou shalt take the young to thyself; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest live long.  
8| If thou shouldest build a new house, then shalt thou make a parapet to thy house; so thou shalt not bring blood-guiltiness upon thy house, if one should in any wise fall from it. 
9| Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with diverse seed, lest the fruit be devoted, and whatsoever seed thou mayest sow, with the fruit of thy vineyard. 
10| Thou shalt not plough with an ox and an ass together. 
11| Thou shalt not wear a mingled <i>garment</i>, woollen and linen together. 
12| Thou shalt make fringes on the four borders of thy garments, with which soever thou mayest be clothed. 
13| And if any one should take a wife, and dwell with her, and hate her, 
14| and attach to her reproachful words, and bring against her an evil name, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to her I found not her tokens of virginity: 
15| then the father and the mother of the damsel shall take and bring out the damsel’s tokens of virginity to the elders of the city to the gate. 
16| And the father of the damsel shall say to the elders, I gave this my daughter to this man for a wife; 
17| and now he has hated her, and attaches reproachful words to her, saying, I have not found tokens of virginity with thy daughter; and these <i>are</i> the tokens of my daughter’s virginity. And they shall unfold the garment before the elders of the city. 
18| And the elders of that city shall take that man, and shall chastise him, 
19| and shall fine him a hundred shekels, and shall give <i>them</i> to the father of the damsel, because he has brought forth an evil name against a virgin of Israel; and she shall be his wife: he shall never be able to put her away.  
20| But if this report be true, and the tokens of virginity be not found for the damsel; 
21| then shall they bring out the damsel to the doors of her father’s house, and shall stone her with stones, and she shall die; because she has wrought folly among the children of Israel, to defile the house of her father by whoring: so thou shalt remove the evil one from among you.  
22| And if a man be found lying with a woman married to a man, ye shall kill them both, the man that lay with the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou remove the wicked one out of Israel. 
23| And if there be a young damsel espoused to a man, and a man should have found her in the city and have lain with her; 
24| ye shall bring them both out to the gate of their city, and they shall be stoned with stones, and they shall die; the damsel, because she cried not in the city; and the man, because he humbled his neighbour’s spouse: so shalt thou remove the evil one from yourselves. 
25| But if a man find in the field a damsel that is betrothed, and he should force her and lie with her, ye shall slay the man that lay with her only. 
26| And the damsel has not <i>committed</i> a sin worthy of death; as if a man should rise up against his neighbour, and slay him, so <i>is</i> this thing; 
27| because he found her in the field; the betrothed damsel cried, and there was none to help her.  
28| And if any one should find a young virgin who has not been betrothed, and should force <i>her</i> and lie with her, and be found, 
29| the man who lay with her shall give to the father of the damsel fifty silver didrachms, and she shall be his wife, because he has humbled her; he shall never be able to put her away. 
30| A man shall not take his father’s wife, and shall not uncover his father’s skirt. 3

1| He that is fractured or mutilated in his private parts shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord. 
2| <i>One born</i> of a harlot shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord.  
3| The Ammanite and Moabite shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord, even until the tenth generation he shall not enter into the assembly of the Lord, even for ever: 
4| because they met you not with bread and water by the way, when ye went out of Egypt; and because they hired against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Mesopotamia to curse thee. 
5| But the Lord thy God would not hearken to Balaam; and the Lord thy God changed the curses into blessings, because the Lord thy God loved thee. 
6| Thou shalt not speak peaceably or profitably to them all thy days for ever. 
7| Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite, because he is thy brother; thou shalt not abhor an Egyptian, because thou wast a stranger in his land. 
8| If sons be born to them, in the third generation they shall enter into the assembly of the Lord. 
9| And if thou shouldest go forth to engage with thine enemies, then thou shalt keep thee from every wicked thing. 
10| If there should be in thee a man who is not clean by reason of his issue by night, then he shall go forth out of the camp, and he shall not enter into the camp. 
11| And it shall come to pass toward evening he shall wash his body with water, and when the sun has gone down, he shall go into the camp. 
12| And thou shalt have a place outside of the camp, and thou shalt go out thither, 
13| and thou shalt have a trowel on thy girdle; and it shall come to pass when thou wouldest relieve thyself abroad, that thou shalt dig with it, and shalt bring back the earth and cover thy nuisance. 
14| Because the Lord thy God walks in thy camp to deliver thee, and to give up thine enemy before thy face; and thy camp shall be holy, and there shall not appear in thee a disgraceful thing, and <i>so</i> he shall turn away from thee. 
15| Thou shalt not deliver a servant to his master, who <i>coming</i> from his master attaches himself to thee. 
16| He shall dwell with thee, he shall dwell among you where he shall please; thou shalt not afflict him. 
17| There shall not be a harlot of the daughters of Israel, and there shall not be a fornicator of the sons of Israel; there shall not be an idolatress of the daughters of Israel, and there shall not be an initiated person of the sons of Israel. 
18| Thou shalt not bring the hire of a harlot, nor the price of a dog into the house of the Lord thy God, for any vow; because even both are an abomination to the Lord thy God.  
19| Thou shalt not lend to thy brother on usury of silver, or usury of meat, or usury of any thing which thou mayest lend out. 
20| Thou mayest lend on usury to a stranger, but to thy brother thou shalt not lend on usury; that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all thy works upon the land, into which thou art entering to inherit it.  
21| And if thou wilt vow a vow to the Lord thy God, thou shalt not delay to pay it; for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee, and <i>otherwise</i> it shall be sin in thee. 
22| But if thou shouldest be unwilling to vow, it is not sin in thee. 
23| Thou shalt observe the words that proceed from between thy lips; and as thou hast vowed a gift to the Lord God, <i>so</i> shalt thou do that which thou hast spoken with thy mouth.  4  &nbsp;

1|  And if thou shouldest go into the corn field of thy neighbour, then thou mayest gather the ears with thy hands; but thou shalt not put the sickle to thy neighbour’s corn. 
2|  And if thou shouldest go into the vineyard of thy neighbour, thou shalt eat grapes sufficient to satisfy thy desire; but thou mayest not put them into a vessel. 
3|  And if any one should take a wife, and should dwell with her, then it shall come to pass if she should not have found favour before him, because he has found some unbecoming thing in her, that he shall write for her a bill of divorcement, and give it into her hands, and he shall send her away out of his house. 
4|  And <i>if</i> she should go away and be married to another man; 
5|  and the last husband should hate her, and write for her a bill of divorcement; and should give it into her hands, and send her away out of his house, and the last husband should die, who took her to himself for a wife; 
4| the former husband who sent her away shall not be able to return and take her to himself for a wife, after she has been defiled; because it is an abomination before the Lord thy God, and ye shall not defile the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit.  
7| And if any one should have recently taken a wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall any thing be laid upon him; he shall be free in his house; for one year he shall cheer his wife whom he has taken. 
8|  Thou shalt not take for a pledge the under millstone, nor the upper millstone; for he who does so takes life for a pledge. 
9|  And if a man should be caught stealing one of his brethren of the children of Israel, and having overcome him he should sell him, that thief shall die; so shalt thou remove that evil one from yourselves. 
10|  Take heed to thyself in <i>regard of</i> the plague of leprosy: thou shalt take great heed to do according to all the law, which the priests the Levites shall report to you; take heed to do, as I have charged you. 
11|  Remember all that the Lord thy God did to Mariam in the way, when ye were going out of Egypt.  
12|  If thy neighbour owe thee a debt, any debt whatsoever, thou shalt not go into his house to take his pledge: 
13|  thou shalt stand without, and the man who is in thy debt shall bring the pledge out to thee. 
14|  And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge. 
15|  Thou shalt surely restore his pledge at sunset, and he shall sleep in his garment, and he shall bless thee; and it shall be mercy to thee before the Lord thy God. 
16|  Thou shalt not unjustly withhold the wages of the poor and needy of thy brethren, or of the strangers who are in thy cities. 
17|  Thou shalt pay him his wages the same day, the sun shall not go down upon it, because he is poor and he trusts in it; and he shall cry against thee to the Lord, and it shall be sin in thee. 
18|  The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, and the sons shall not be put to death for the fathers; every one shall be put to death for his own sin. 
19|  Thou shalt not wrest the judgment of the stranger and the fatherless, and widow; thou shalt not take the widow’s garment for a pledge. 
20|  And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt, and the Lord thy God redeemed thee from thence; therefore I charge thee to do this thing.  
21|  And when thou shalt have reaped corn in thy field, and shalt have forgotten a sheaf in thy field, thou shalt not return to take it; it shall be for the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, that the Lord thy God may bless thee in all the works of thy hands. 
22|  And if thou shouldest gather thine olives, thou shalt not return to collect the remainder; it shall be for the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing. 
23|  And when soever thou shalt gather the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean what thou hast left; it shall be for the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow: 
24|  and thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt; therefore I command thee to do this thing. 5

1| And if there should be a dispute between men, and they should come forward to judgment, and <i>the judges</i> judge, and justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked: 
2| then it shall come to pass, if the unrighteous should be worthy of stripes, thou shalt lay him down before the judges, and they shall scourge him before them according to his iniquity. 
3| And they shall scourge him with forty stripes in number, they shall not inflict more; for if thou shouldest scourge him <i>with</i> more stripes beyond these stripes, thy brother will be disgraced before thee. 
4| Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treads out the corn. 
5| And if brethren should live together, and one of them should die, and should not have seed, the wife of the deceased shall not marry out <i>of the family</i> to a man not related: her husband’s brother shall go in to her, and shall take her to himself for a wife, and shall dwell with her. 
6| And it shall come to pass that the child which she shall bear, shall be named by the name of the deceased, and his name shall not be blotted out of Israel.  
7| And if the man should not be willing to take his brother’s wife, then shall the woman go up to the gate to the elders, and she shall say, My husband’s brother will not raise up the name of his brother in Israel, my husband’s brother has refused. 
8| And the elders of his city shall call him, and speak to him; and if he stand and say, I will not take her: 
9| then his brother’s wife shall come forward before the elders, and shall loose one shoe from off his foot, and shall spit in his face, and shall answer and say, Thus shall they do to the man who will not build his brother’s house in Israel. 
10| And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that has had his shoe loosed.  
11| And if men should strive together, a man with his brother, and the wife of one of them should advance to rescue her husband out of the hand of him that smites him, and she should stretch forth her hand, and take hold of his private parts; 
12| thou shalt cut off her hand; thine eye shall not spare her. 
13| Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a small. 
14| Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great and a small. 
15| Thou shalt have a true and just weight, and a true and just measure, that thou mayest live long upon the land which the Lord thy God gives thee for an inheritance. 
16| For every one that does this <i>is</i> an abomination to the Lord thy God, even every one that does injustice.  
17| Remember what things Amalec did to thee by the way, when thou wentest forth out of the land of Egypt: 
18| how he withstood thee in the way, and harassed thy rear, <i>even</i> those that were weary behind thee, and thou didst hunger and wast weary; and he did not fear God. 
19| And it shall come to pass whenever the Lord thy God shall have given thee rest from all thine enemies round about thee, in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit, thou shalt blot out the name of Amalec from under heaven, and shalt not forget <i>to do it</i>. 6  

#26
1| And it shall be when thou shalt have entered into the land, which the Lord thy God gives thee to inherit it, and thou shalt have inherited it, and thou shalt have dwelt upon it, 
2| that thou shalt take of the first of the fruits of thy land, which the Lord thy God gives thee, and thou shalt put them into a basket, and thou shalt go to the place which the Lord thy God shall choose to have his name called there. 
3| And thou shalt come to the priest who shall be in those days, and thou shalt say to him, I testify this day to the Lord my God, that I am come into the land which the Lord sware to our fathers to give to us. 
4| And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hands, and shall set it before the altar of the Lord thy God: 
5| and he shall answer and say before the Lord thy God, My father abandoned Syria, and went down into Egypt, and sojourned there with a small number, and became there a mighty nation and a great multitude. 
6| And the Egyptians afflicted us, and humbled us, and imposed hard tasks on us: 
7| and we cried to the Lord our God, and the Lord heard our voice, and saw our humiliation, and our labour, and our affliction. 
8| And the Lord brought us out of Egypt himself with his great strength, and his mighty hand, and his high arm, and with great visions, and with signs, and with wonders. 
9| And he brought us into this place, and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
10| And now, behold, I have brought the first of the fruits of the land, which thou gavest me, O Lord, a land flowing with milk and honey: and thou shalt leave it before the Lord thy God, and thou shalt worship before the Lord thy God; 
11| and thou shalt rejoice in all the good <i>things</i>, which the Lord thy God has given thee, <i>thou</i> and thy family, and the Levite, and the stranger that is within thee. 
12| And when thou shalt have completed all the tithings of thy fruits in the third year, thou shalt give the second tenth to the Levite, and stranger, and fatherless, and widow; and they shall eat it in thy cities, and be merry.  
13| And thou shalt say before the Lord thy God, I have fully collected the holy things out of my house, and I have given them to the Levite, and the stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, according to all commands which thou didst command me: I did not transgress thy command, and I did not forget it. 
14| And in my distress I did not eat of them, I have not gathered of them for an unclean purpose, I have not given of them to the dead; I have hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God, I have done as thou hast commanded me. 
15| Look down from thy holy house, from heaven, and bless thy people Israel, and the land which thou hast given them, as thou didst swear to our fathers, to give to us a land flowing with milk and honey. 
16| On this day the Lord thy God charged thee to keep all the ordinances and judgments; and ye shall observe and do them, with all your heart, and with all your soul. 
17| Thou hast chosen God this day to be thy God, and to walk in all his ways, and to observe his ordinances and judgments, and to hearken to his voice. 
18| And the Lord has chosen thee this day that thou shouldest be to him a peculiar people, as he said, to keep his commands; 
19| and that thou shouldest be above all nations, as he has made thee renowned, and a boast, and glorious, that thou shouldest be a holy people to the Lord thy God, as he has spoken. 7

1| And Moses and the elders of Israel commanded, saying, Keep all these commands, all that I command you this day. 
2| And it shall come to pass in the day when ye shall cross over Jordan into the land which the Lord thy God gives thee, that thou shalt set up for thyself great stones, and shalt plaster them with plaster. 
3| And thou shalt write on these stones all the words of this law, as soon as ye have crossed Jordan, when ye are entered into the land, which the Lord God of thy fathers gives thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, according as the Lord God of thy fathers said to thee. 
4| And it shall be as soon as ye are gone over Jordan, ye shall set up these stones, which I command thee this day, on mount Gaebal, and thou shalt plaster them with plaster. 
5| And thou shalt build there an altar to the Lord thy God, an altar of stones; thou shalt not lift up iron upon it. 
6| Of whole stones shalt thou build an altar to the Lord thy God, and thou shalt offer upon it whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord thy God. 
7| And thou shalt there offer a peace-offering; and thou shalt eat and be filled, and rejoice before the Lord thy God. 
8| And thou shalt write upon the stones all this law very plainly.  
9| And Moses and the priests the Levites spoke to all Israel, saying, Be silent and hear, O Israel; this day thou art become a people to the Lord thy God. 
10| And thou shalt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and shalt do all his commands, and his ordinances, as many as I command thee this day. 
11| And Moses charged the people on that day, saying, 
12| These shall stand to bless the people on mount Garizin having gone over Jordan; Symeon, Levi, Judas, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 
13| And these shall stand for cursing on mount Gaebal; Ruben, Gad, and Aser, Zabulon, Dan, and Nephthali.  
14| And the Levites shall answer and say to all Israel with a loud voice, 
15| Cursed <i>is</i> the man whosoever shall make a graven or molten image, an abomination to the Lord, the work of the hands of craftsmen, and shall put it in a secret place: and all the people shall answer and say, So be it. 
16| Cursed is the man that dishonours his father or his mother: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
17| Cursed is he that removes his neighbour’s landmarks: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
18| Cursed is he that makes the blind to wander in the way: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
19| Cursed is every one that shall pervert the judgment of the stranger, and orphan, and widow: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
20| Cursed is he that lies with his father’s wife, because he has uncovered his father’s skirt: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
21| Cursed is he that lies with any beast: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
22| Cursed is he that lies with his sister by his father or his mother: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
23| Cursed is he that lies with his daughter-in-law: and all the people shall say, So be it. Cursed is he that lies with his wife’s sister: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
24| Cursed is he that smites his neighbour secretly: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
25| Cursed is he whosoever shall have taken a bribe to slay an innocent man: and all the people shall say, So be it. 
26| Cursed is every man that continues not in all the words of this law to do them: and all the people shall say, So be it. 8

1| And it shall come to pass, if thou wilt indeed hear the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe and do all these commands, which I charge thee this day, that the Lord thy God shall set thee on high above all the nations of the earth; 
2| and all these blessings shall come upon thee, and shall find thee. If thou wilt indeed hear the voice of the Lord thy God, 
3| blessed <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i> in the city, and blessed shalt thou be in the field. 
4| Blessed shall be the offspring of thy body, and the fruits of thy land, and the herds of thy oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep. 
5| Blessed shall be thy barns, and thy stores. 
6| Blessed shalt thou be in thy coming in, and blessed shalt thou be in thy going out.  
7| The Lord deliver thine enemies that withstand thee utterly broken before thy face: they shall come out against thee one way, and they shall flee seven ways from before thee. 
8| The Lord send upon thee his blessing in thy barns, and on all on which thou shalt put thine hand, in the land which the Lord thy God gives thee. 
9| The Lord raise thee up for himself a holy people, as he sware to thy fathers; if thou wilt hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and walk in all his ways. 
10| And all the nations of the earth shall see thee, that the name of the Lord is called upon thee, and they shall stand in awe of thee. 
11| And the Lord thy God shall multiply thee for good in the offspring of thy body, and in the offspring of thy cattle, and in the fruits of thy land, on thy land which the Lord sware to thy fathers to give to thee.  
12| May the Lord open to thee his good treasure, the heaven, to give rain to thy land in season: may he bless all the works of thy hands: so shalt thou lend to many nations, but thou shalt not borrow; and thou shalt rule over many nations, but they shall not rule over thee. 
13| The Lord thy God make thee the head, and not the tail; and thou shalt then be above and thou shalt not be below, if thou wilt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, in all things that I charge thee this day to observe. 
14| Thou shalt not turn aside from any of the commandments, which I charge thee this day, to the right hand or to the left, to go after other gods to serve them. 
15| But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to observe all his commandments, as many as I charge thee this day, then all these curses shall come on thee, and overtake thee. 
16| Cursed <i>shalt</i> thou <i>be</i> in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in the field. 
17| Cursed shall be thy barns and thy stores. 
18| Cursed shall be the offspring of thy body, and the fruits of thy land, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep. 
19| Cursed shalt thou be in thy coming in, and cursed shalt thou be in thy going out.  
20| The Lord send upon thee want, and famine, and consumption of all things on which thou shalt put thy hand, until he shall have utterly destroyed thee, and until he shall have consumed thee quickly because of thine evil devices, because thou hast forsaken me. 
21| The Lord cause the pestilence to cleave to thee, until he shall have consumed thee off the land into which thou goest to inherit it. 
22| The Lord smite thee with distress, and fever, and cold, and inflammation, and blighting, and paleness, and they shall pursue thee until they have destroyed thee. 
23| And thou shalt have over thine head a sky of brass, and the earth under thee shall be iron. 
24| The Lord thy God make the rain of thy land dust; and dust shall come down from heaven, until it shall have destroyed thee, and until it shall have quickly consumed thee. 
25| The Lord give thee up for slaughter before thine enemies: thou shalt go out against them one way, and flee from their face seven ways; and thou shalt be a dispersion in all the kingdoms of the earth. 
26| And your dead men shall be food to the birds of the sky, and to the beasts of the earth; and there shall be none to scare them away. 
27| The Lord smite thee with the botch of Egypt in the seat, and with a malignant scab, and itch, so that thou canst not be healed. 
28| The Lord smite thee with insanity, and blindness, and astonishment of mind. 
29| And thou shalt grope at mid-day, as a blind man would grope in the darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways; and then thou shalt be unjustly treated, and plundered continually, and there shall be no helper.  
30| thou shalt take a wife, and another man shall have her; thou shalt build a house, and thou shalt not dwell in it; thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes of it. 
31| Thy calf <i>shall be</i> slain before thee, and thou shalt not eat of it; thine ass shall be violently taken away from thee, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep shall be given to thine enemies, and thou shalt have no helper. 
32| Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given to another nation, and thine eyes wasting away shall look for them: thine hand shall have no strength. 
33| A nation which thou knowest not shall eat the produce of thy land, and all thy labours; and thou shalt be injured and crushed always. 
34| And thou shalt be distracted, because of the sights of thine eyes which thou shalt see.  
35| The Lord smite thee with an evil sore, on the knees and the legs, so that thou shalt not be able to be healed from the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head.  
36| The Lord carry away thee and thy princes, whom thou shalt set over thee, to a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers know; and thou shalt there serve other gods, wood and stone. 
37| An thou shalt be there for a wonder, and a parable, and a tale, among all the nations, to which the Lord thy God shall carry thee away.  
38| Thou shalt carry forth much seed into the field, and thou shalt bring in little, because the locust shall devour it. 
39| Thou shalt plant a vineyard, and dress it, and shalt not drink the wine, neither shalt thou delight thyself with it, because the worm shall devour it. 
40| Thou shalt have olive trees in all thy borders, and thou shalt not anoint thee with oil, because thine olive shall utterly cast <i>its fruit</i>. 
41| Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, and they shall not be <i>thine</i>, for they shall depart into captivity. 
42| All thy trees and the fruits of thy land shall the blight consume. 
43| The stranger that is within thee shall get up very high, and thou shalt come down very low. 
44| He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail. 
45| And all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall pursue thee, and shall overtake thee, until he shall have consumed thee, and until he shall have destroyed thee; because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commands, and his ordinances which he has commanded thee. 
46| And <i>these things</i> shall be signs in thee, and wonders among thy seed for ever; 
47| because thou didst not serve the Lord thy God with gladness and a good heart, because of the abundance of all things.  
48| And thou shalt serve thine enemies, which the Lord will send forth against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness, and in the want of all things; and thou shalt wear upon thy neck a yoke of iron until he shall have destroyed thee. 
49| The Lord shall bring upon thee a nation from the extremity of the earth, like the swift flying of an eagle, a nation whose voice thou shalt not understand; 
50| a nation bold in countenance, which shall not respect the person of the aged and shall not pity the young. 
51| And it shall eat up the young of thy cattle, and the fruits of thy land, so as not to leave to thee corn, wine, oil, the herds of thine oxen, and the flocks of thy sheep, until it shall have destroyed thee; 
52| and have utterly crushed thee in thy cities, until the high and strong walls be destroyed, in which thou trustest, in all thy land; and it shall afflict thee in thy cities, which he has given to thee. 
53| And thou shalt eat the fruit of thy body, the flesh of thy sons and of thy daughters, all that he has given thee, in thy straitness and thy affliction, with which thine enemy shall afflict thee.  
54| He that is tender and very delicate within thee shall look with an evil eye upon his brother, and the wife in his bosom, and the children that are left, which may have been left to him; 
55| so as <i>not</i> to give to one of them of the flesh of his children, whom he shall eat, because of his having nothing left him in thy straitness, and in thy affliction, with which thine enemies shall afflict thee in all thy cities.  
56| And she that is tender and delicate among you, whose foot has not assayed to go upon the earth for delicacy and tenderness, shall look with an evil eye on her husband in her bosom, and her son and her daughter, 
57| and her offspring that comes out between her feet, and the child which she shall bear; for she shall eat them because of the want of all things, secretly in thy straitness, and in thy affliction, with which thine enemy shall afflict thee in thy cities. 
58| If thou wilt not hearken to do all the words of this law, which have been written in this book, to fear this glorious and wonderful name, the Lord thy God; 
59| then the Lord shall magnify thy plagues, and the plagues of thy seed, great and wonderful plagues, and evil and abiding diseases. 
60| And he shall bring upon thee all the evil pain of Egypt, of which thou wast afraid, and they shall cleave to thee. 
61| And the Lord shall bring upon thee every sickness, and every plague that is not written, and every one that is written in the book of this law, until he shall have destroyed thee. 
62| And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the stars of the sky in multitude; because thou didst not hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God.  
63| And it shall come to pass that as the Lord rejoiced over you to do you good, and to multiply you, so the Lord will rejoice over you to destroy you; and ye shall be quickly removed from the land, into which ye go to inherit it. 
64| And the Lord thy God shall scatter thee among all nations, from one end of the earth to the other; and thou shalt there serve other gods, wood and stone, which thou hast not known, nor thy fathers. 
65| Moreover among those nations he will not give thee quiet, neither by any means shall the sole of thy foot have rest; and the Lord shall give thee there another and a misgiving heart, and failing eyes, and a wasting soul. 
66| And thy life shall be in suspense before thine eyes; and thou shalt be afraid by day and by night, and thou shalt have no assurance of thy life. 
67| In the morning thou shalt say, Would it were evening! and in the evening thou shalt say, Would it were morning! for the fear of thine heart with which thou shalt fear, and for the sights of thine eyes which thou shalt see. 
68| And the Lord shall bring thee back to Egypt in ships, by the way of which I said, Thou shalt not see it again; and ye shall be sold there to your enemies for bondmen and bondwomen, and none shall buy you. 9

1| These <i>are</i> the words of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Choreb.  
2| And Moses called all the sons of Israel and said to them, Ye have seen all things that the Lord did in the land of Egypt before you to Pharao and his servants, and all his land; 
3| the great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs, and those great wonders. 
4| Yet the Lord God has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, until this day. 
5| And he led you forty years in the wilderness; your garments did not grow old, and your sandals were not worn away off your feet. 
6| Ye did not eat bread, ye did not drink wine or strong drink, that ye might know that I <i>am</i> the Lord your God. 
7| And ye came as far as this place; and there came forth Seon king of Esebon, and Og king of Basan, to meet us in war. 
8| And we smote them and took their land, and I gave it for an inheritance to Ruben and Gad, and to the half-tribe of Manasse. 
9| And ye shall take heed to do all the words of this covenant, that ye may understand all things that ye shall do. 
10| Ye all stand to-day before the Lord your God, the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your officers, every man of Israel, 
11| your wives, and your children, and the stranger who is in the midst of your camp, from your hewer of wood even to your drawer of water, 
12| that thou shouldest enter into the covenant of the Lord thy God and into his oaths, as many as the Lord thy God appoints thee this day; 
13| that he may appoint thee to himself for a people, and he shall be thy God, as he said to thee, and as he sware to thy fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob. 
14| And I do not appoint to you alone this covenant and this oath; 
15| but to those also who are here with you to-day before the Lord your God, and to those who are not here with you to-day.  
16| For ye know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, how we came through the midst of the nations through whom ye came. 
17| And ye beheld their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which are among them. 
18| Lest there be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart has turned aside from the Lord your God, having gone to serve the gods of these nations; lest there be in you a root springing up with gall and bitterness. 
19| And it shall be if one shall hear the words of this curse, and shall flatter himself in his heart, saying, Let good happen to me, for I will walk in the error of my heart, lest the sinner destroy the guiltless with <i>him</i>: 
20| God shall by no means be willing to pardon him, but then the wrath of the Lord and his jealousy shall flame out against that man; and all the curses of this covenant shall attach themselves to him, which are written in this book, and the Lord shall blot out his name from under heaven. 
21| And the Lord shall separate that man for evil of all the children of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in the book of this law.  
22| And another generation shall say—even your sons who shall rise up after you, and the stranger who shall come from a land afar off, and shall see the plagues of that land and their diseases, which the Lord has sent upon it, 
23| brimstone and burning salt, (the whole land shall not be sown, neither shall any green thing spring, nor rise upon it, as Sodom and Gomorrha were overthrown, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord overthrew in his wrath and anger:)— 
24| and all the nations shall say, Why has the Lord done thus to this land? what <i>is</i> this great fierceness of anger? 
25| And <i>men</i> shall say, Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord God of their fathers, the things which he appointed to their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt: 
26| and they went and served other gods, which they knew not, neither did he assign <i>them</i> to them. 
27| And the Lord was exceedingly angry with that land to bring upon it according to all the curses which are written in the book of this law. 
28| And the Lord removed them from their land in anger, and wrath, and very great indignation, and cast them out into another land as at present.  
29| The secret things <i>belong</i> to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed <i>belong</i> to us and to our children for ever, to do all the words of this law. 0  

#30
1| And it shall come to pass when all these things shall have come upon thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before thy face, and thou shalt call <i>them</i> to mind among all the nations, wherein the Lord shall have scattered thee, 
2| and shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hearken to his voice, according to all things which I charge thee this day, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul; 
3| then the Lord shall heal thine iniquities, and shall pity thee, and shall again gather thee out from all the nations, among which the Lord has scattered thee. 
4| If thy dispersion be from one end of heaven to the other, thence will the Lord thy God gather thee, and thence will the Lord thy God take thee. 
5| And the Lord thy God shall bring thee in from thence into the land which thy fathers have inherited, and thou shalt inherit it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers. 
6| And the Lord shall purge thy heart, and the heart of thy seed, to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.  
7| And the Lord thy God will put these curses upon thine enemies, and upon those that hate thee, who have persecuted thee. 
8| And thou shalt return and hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, and shall keep his commands, all that I charge thee this day. 
9| And the Lord thy God shall bless thee in every work of thine hands, in the offspring of thy body, and in the offspring of thy cattle, and in the fruits of thy land, because the Lord thy God will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy fathers: 
10| if thou wilt hearken to the voice of the Lord thy God, to keep his commandments, and his ordinances, and his judgments written in the book of this law, if thou turn to the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul. 
11| For this command which I give thee this day is not grievous, neither is it far from thee. 
12| It is not in heaven above, <i>as if there were one</i> saying, Who shall go up for us into heaven, and shall take it for us, and we will hear and do it? 
13| Neither is it beyond the sea, saying, Who will go over for us to the other side of the sea, and take it for us, and make it audible to us, and we will do it? 
14| The word is very near thee, in thy mouth, and in thine heart, and in thine hands to do it. 
15| Behold, I have set before thee this day life and death, good and evil. 
16| If thou wilt hearken to the commands of the Lord thy God, which I command thee this day, to love the Lord thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to keep his ordinances, and his judgments; then ye shall live, and shall be many in number, and the Lord thy God shall bless thee in all the land into which thou goest to inherit it. 
17| But if thy heart change, and thou wilt not hearken, and thou shalt go astray and worship other gods, and serve them, 
18| I declare to you this day, that ye shall utterly perish, and ye shall by no means live long upon the land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it. 
19| I call both heaven and earth to witness this day against you, I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: choose thou life, that thou and thy seed may live; 
20| to love the Lord thy God, to hearken to his voice, and cleave to him; for this <i>is</i> thy life, and the length of thy days, that thou shouldest dwell upon the land, which the Lord sware to thy fathers, Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, to give to them. 1  

#31
1| And Moses finished speaking all these words to all the children of Israel; 
2| and said to them, I am this day a hundred and twenty years <i>old</i>; I shall not be able any longer to come in or go out; and the Lord said to me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan. 
3| The Lord thy God who goes before thee, he shall destroy these nations before thee, and thou shalt inherit them: and <i>it shall be</i> Joshua that goes before thy face, as the Lord has spoken. 
4| And the Lord thy God shall do to them as he did to Seon and Og the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond Jordan, and to their land, as he destroyed them. 
5| And the Lord has delivered them to you; and ye shall do to them, as I charged you. 
6| Be courageous and strong, fear not, neither be cowardly neither be afraid before them; for <i>it is</i> the Lord your God that advances with you in the midst of you, neither will he by any means forsake thee, nor desert thee. 
7| And Moses called Joshua, and said to him before all Israel, Be courageous and strong; for thou shalt go in before this people into the land which the Lord sware to your fathers to give to them, and thou shalt give it to them for an inheritance. 
8| And the Lord that goes with thee shall not forsake thee nor abandon thee; fear not, neither be afraid. 
9| And Moses wrote the words of this law in a book, and gave it to the priests the sons of Levi who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to the elders of the sons of Israel.  
10| And Moses charged them in that day, saying, After seven years, in the time of the year of release, in the feast of tabernacles, 
11| when all Israel come together to appear before the Lord your God, in the place which the Lord shall choose, ye shall read this law before all Israel in their ears, 
12| having assembled the people, the men, and the women, and the children, and the stranger that is in your cities, that they may hear, and that they may learn to fear the Lord your God; and they shall hearken to do all the words of this law. 
13| And their sons who have not known shall hear, and shall learn to fear the Lord thy God all the days that they live upon the land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it. 
14| And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, the days of thy death are at hand; call Joshua, and stand ye by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony, and I will give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went to the tabernacle of testimony, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony. 
15| And the Lord descended in a cloud, and stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony; and the pillar of the cloud stood by the doors of the tabernacle of testimony. 
16| And the Lord said to Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people will arise and go a whoring after the strange gods of the land, into which they are entering: and they will forsake me, and break my covenant, which I made with them. 
17| And I will be very angry with them in that day, and I will leave them and turn my face away from them, and they shall be devoured; and many evils and afflictions shall come upon them; and they shall say in that day, Because the Lord my God is not with me, these evils have come upon me. 
18| And I will surely turn away my face from them in that day, because of all their evil doings which they have done, because they turned aside after strange gods.  
19| And now write the words of this song, and teach it to the children of Israel, and ye shall put it into their mouth, that this song may witness for me among the children of Israel to their face. 
20| For I will bring them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers, to give to them a land flowing with milk and honey: and they shall eat and be filled and satisfy <i>themselves</i>; then will they turn aside after other gods, and serve them, and they will provoke me, and break my covenant. 
21| And this song shall stand up to witness against them; for they shall not forget it out of their mouth, or out of the mouth of their seed; for I know their wickedness, what they are doing here this day, before I have brought them into the good land, which I sware to their fathers. 
22| And Moses wrote this song in that day, and taught it to the children of Israel. 
23| And he charged Joshua, and said, Be courageous and strong, for thou shalt bring the sons of Israel into the land, which the Lord sware to them, and he shall be with thee.  
24| And when Moses finished writing all the words of this law in a book, even to the end, 
25| then he charged the Levites who bear the ark of the covenant of the Lord, saying, 
26| Take the book of this law, and ye shall put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God; and it shall be there among you for a testimony. 
27| For I know thy provocation, and thy stiff neck; for yet during my life with you at this day, ye have been provoking in your conduct toward God: how shall ye not also be so after my death? 
28| Gather together to me the heads of your tribes, and your elders, and your judges, and your officers, that I may speak in their ears all these words; and I call both heaven and earth to witness against them. 
29| For I know that after my death ye will utterly transgress, and turn aside out of the way which I have commanded you; and evils shall come upon you in the latter days, because ye will do evil before the Lord, to provoke him to anger by the works of your hands.  And Moses spoke all the words of this song even to the end, in the ears of the whole assembly. 2  

#32
1| Attend, O heaven, and I will speak; and let the earth hear the words out of my mouth. 
2| Let my speech be looked for as the rain, and my words come down as dew, as the shower upon the herbage, and as snow upon the grass. 
3| For I have called on the name of the Lord: assign ye greatness to our God. 
4| <i>As for God</i>, his works <i>are</i> true, and all his ways <i>are</i> judgment: God <i>is</i> faithful, and there is no unrighteousness <i>in him</i>; just and holy <i>is</i> the Lord. 
5| They have sinned, not <i>pleasing</i> him; spotted children, a froward and perverse generation. 
6| Do ye thus recompense the Lord? <i>is the</i> people thus foolish and unwise? did not he himself thy father purchase thee, and make thee, and form thee? 
7| Remember the days of old, consider the years for past ages: ask thy father, and he shall relate to thee, thine elders, and they shall tell thee.  
8| When the Most High divided the nations, when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the nations according to the number of the angels of God. 
9| And his people Jacob became the portion of the Lord, Israel was the line of his inheritance. 
10| He maintained him in the wilderness, in burning thirst and a dry land: he led him about and instructed him, and kept him as the apple of an eye. 
11| As an eagle would watch over his brood, and yearns over his young, receives them having spread his wings, and takes them up on his back: 
12| the Lord alone led them, there was no strange god with them. 
13| He brought them up on the strength of the land; he fed them with the fruits of the fields; they sucked honey out of the rock, and oil out of the solid rock. 
14| Butter of cows, and milk of sheep, with the fat of lambs and rams, of calves and kids, with fat of kidneys of wheat; and he drank wine, the blood of the grape. 
15| So Jacob ate and was filled, and the beloved one kicked; he grew fat, he became thick and broad: then he forsook the God that made him, and departed from God his Saviour.  
16| They provoked me to anger with strange gods; with their abominations they bitterly angered me. 
17| They sacrificed to devils, and not to God; to gods whom they knew not: new and fresh <i>gods</i> came in, whom their fathers knew not. 
18| Thou hast forsaken God that begot thee, and forgotten God who feeds thee. 
19| And the Lord saw, and was jealous; and was provoked by the anger of his sons and daughters, 
20| and said, I will turn away my face from them, and will show what shall happen to them in the last days; for it is a perverse generation, sons in whom is no faith.  
21| They have provoked me to jealousy with <i>that which is</i> not God, they have exasperated me with their idols; and I will provoke them to jealousy with them that are no nation, I will anger them with a nation void of understanding. 
22| For a fire has been kindled out of my wrath, it shall burn to hell below; it shall devour the land, and the fruits of it; it shall set on fire the foundations of the mountains. 
23| I will gather evils upon them, and will fight with my weapons against them. 
24| <i>They shall be</i> consumed with hunger and the devouring of birds, and there shall be irremediable destruction: I will send forth against them the teeth of wild beasts, with the rage of <i>serpents</i> creeping on the ground. 
25| Without, the sword shall bereave them of children, and terror <i>shall issue</i> out of the secret chambers; the young man shall perish with the virgin, the suckling with him who has grown old. 
26| I said, I will scatter them, and I will cause their memorial to cease from among men. 
27| Were it not for the wrath of the enemy, lest they should live long, lest their enemies should combine against them; lest they should say, Our own high arm, and not the Lord, has done all these things.  
28| It is a nation that has lost counsel, neither is there understanding in them. 
29| They had not sense to understand: let them reserve these things against the time to come. 
30| How should one pursue a thousand, and two rout tens of thousands, if God had not sold them, and the Lord delivered them up? 
31| For their gods are not as our God, but our enemies <i>are</i> void of understanding. 
32| For their vine <i>is</i> of the vine of Sodom, and their vine-branch of Gomorrha: their grape <i>is</i> a grape of gall, their cluster <i>is</i> one of bitterness. 
33| Their wine <i>is</i> the rage of serpents, and the incurable rage of asps. 
34| Lo! are not these things stored up by me, and sealed among my treasures? 
35| In the day of vengeance I will recompense, whensoever their foot shall be tripped up; for the day of their destruction <i>is</i> near to them, and the judgments at hand are close upon you. 
36| For the Lord shall judge his people, and shall be comforted over his servants; for he saw that they were utterly weakened, and failed in the hostile invasion, and were become feeble: 
37| and the Lord said, Where are their gods on whom they trusted? 
38| the fat of whose sacrifices ye ate, and ye drank the wine of their drink-offerings? let them arise and help you, and be your protectors. 
39| Behold, behold that I am <i>he</i>, and there is no god beside me: I kill, and I will make to live: I will smite, and I will heal; and there is none who shall deliver out of my hands. 
40| For I will lift up my hand to heaven, and swear by my right hand, and I will say, I live for ever. 
41| For I will sharpen my sword like lightning, and my hand shall take hold of judgment; and I will render judgment to my enemies, and will recompense them that hate me. 
42| I will make my weapons drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, <i>it shall glut itself</i> with the blood of the wounded, and from the captivity of the heads of <i>their</i> enemies that rule over them.  
43| Rejoice, ye heavens, with him, and let all the angels of God worship him; rejoice ye Gentiles, with his people, and let all the sons of God strengthen themselves in him; for he will avenge the blood of his sons, and he will render vengeance, and recompense justice to his enemies, and will reward them that hate him; and the Lord shall purge the land of his people. 
44| And Moses wrote this song in that day, and taught it to the children of Israel; and Moses went in and spoke all the words of this law in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the <i>son</i> of Naue. 
45| And Moses finished speaking to all Israel. 
46| And he said to them, Take heed with your heart to all these words, which I testify to you this day, which ye shall command your sons, to observe and do all the words of this law. 
47| For this <i>is</i> no vain word to you; for it <i>is</i> your life, and because of this word ye shall live long upon the land, into which ye go over Jordan to inherit it. 
48| And the Lord spoke to Moses in this day, saying, 
49| Go up to the mount Abarim, this mountain Nabau which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho, and behold the land of Chanaan, which I give to the sons of Israel: 
50| and die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be added to thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Or, and was added to his people. 
51| Because ye disobeyed my word among the children of Israel, at the waters of strife of Cades in the wilderness of Sin; because ye sanctified me not among the sons of Israel. 
52| Thou shalt see the land before <i>thee</i>, but thou shalt not enter into it. 3  

#33
1| And this <i>is</i> the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death. 
2| And he said, The Lord is come from Sina, and has appeared from Seir to us, and has hasted out of the mount of Pharan, with the ten thousands of Cades; on his right hand <i>were</i> his angels with him. 
3| And he spared his people, and all his sanctified ones <i>are</i> under thy hands; and they are under thee; and he received of his words 
4| the law which Moses charged us, an inheritance to the assemblies of Jacob. 
5| And he shall be prince with the beloved one, when the princes of the people are gathered together with the tribes of Israel. 
6| Let Ruben live, and not die; and let him be many in number.  
7| And this <i>is the blessing</i> of Juda; Hear, Lord, the voice of Juda, and do thou visit his people: his hands shall contend for him, and thou shalt be a help from his enemies. 
8| And to Levi he said, Give to Levi his manifestations, and his truth to the holy man, whom they tempted in the temptation; they reviled him at the water of strife. 
9| Who says to his father and mother, I have not seen thee; and he knew not his brethren, and he refused to know his sons: he kept thine oracles, and observed thy covenant. 
10| They shall declare thine ordinances to Jacob, and thy law to Israel: they shall place incense in <i>the time of</i> thy wrath continually upon thine altar. 
11| Bless, Lord, his strength, and accept the works of his hands; break the loins of his enemies that have risen up against him, and let not them that hate him rise up. 
12| And to Benjamin he said, The beloved of the Lord shall dwell in confidence, and God overshadows him always, and he rested between his shoulders.  
13| And to Joseph he said, His land <i>is</i> of the blessing of the Lord, of the seasons of sky and dew, and of the deeps of wells below, 
14| and of the fruits of the changes of the sun in season, and of the produce of the months, 
15| from the top of the ancient mountains, and from the top of the everlasting hills, 
16| and of the fullness of the land in season: and let the things pleasing to him that dwelt in the bush come on the head of Joseph, and on the crown <i>of him who was</i> glorified above his brethren. 
17| His beauty <i>is as</i> the firstling of his bull, his horns <i>are</i> the horns of a unicorn; with them he shall thrust the nations at once, even from the end of the earth: these <i>are</i> the ten thousands of Ephraim, and these <i>are</i> the thousands of Manasse. 
18| And to Zabulon he said, Rejoice, Zabulon, in thy going out, and Issachar in his tents. 
19| They shall utterly destroy the nations, and ye shall call <i>men</i> there, and there offer the sacrifice of righteousness; for the wealth of the sea shall suckle thee, and so shall the marts of them that dwell by the sea-coast.  
20| And to Gad he said, Blessed <i>be</i> he that enlarges Gad: as a lion he rested, having broken the arm and the ruler. 
21| And he saw his first-fruits, that there the land of the princes gathered with the chiefs of the people was divided; the Lord wrought righteousness, and his judgment with Israel. 
22| And to Dan he said, Dan <i>is</i> a lion’s whelp, and shall leap out of Basan. 
23| And to Nephthali he said, Nephthali <i>has</i> the fulness of good things; and let him be filled with blessing from the Lord: he shall inherit the west and the south. 
24| And to Aser he said, Aser <i>is</i> blessed with children; and he shall be acceptable to his brethren: he shall dip his foot in oil. 
25| His sandal shall be iron and brass; as thy days, so <i>shall be</i> thy strength. 
26| There is not <i>any such</i> as the God of the beloved; he who rides upon the heaven <i>is</i> thy helper, and the magnificent One of the firmament. 
27| And the rule of God shall protect thee, and <i>that</i> under the strength of the everlasting arms; and he shall cast forth the enemy from before thy face, saying, Perish. 
28| And Israel shall dwell in confidence alone on the land of Jacob, with corn and wine; and the sky <i>shall be</i> misty with dew upon thee. 
29| Blessed <i>art</i> thou, O Israel; who <i>is</i> like to thee, O people saved by the Lord? thy helper shall hold his shield over thee, and <i>his</i> sword <i>is</i> thy boast; and thine enemies shall speak falsely to thee, and thou shalt tread upon their neck. 4

1| And Moses went up from Araboth Moab to the mount of Nabau, to the top of Phasga, which is before Jericho; and the Lord shewed him all the mount of Galaad to Dan, and all the land of Nephthali, 
2| and all the land of Ephraim and Manasse, and all the land of Juda to the farthest sea; 
3| and the wilderness, and the country round about Jericho, the city of palm-trees, to Segor. 
4| And the Lord said to Moses, This <i>is</i> the land of which I sware to Abraam, and Isaac, and Jacob, saying, To your seed will I give it: and I have shewed it to thine eyes, but thou shalt not go in thither. 
5| So Moses the servant of the Lord died in the land of Moab by the word of the Lord. 
6| And they buried him in Gai near the house of Phogor; and no one has seen his sepulchre to this day. 
7| And Moses was a hundred and twenty years old at his death; his eyes were not dimmed, nor were his natural powers destroyed.  
8| And the children of Israel wept for Moses in Araboth of Moab at Jordan near Jericho thirty days; and the days of the sad mourning for Moses were completed. 
9| And Joshua the son of Naue was filled with the spirit of knowledge, for Moses had laid his hands upon him; and the children of Israel hearkened to him; and they did as the Lord commanded Moses. 
10| And there rose up no more a prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew face to face, 
11| in all the signs and wonders, which the Lord sent him to work in Egypt on Pharao, and his servants, and all his land; 
12| the great wonders, and the mighty hand which Moses displayed before all Israel.
