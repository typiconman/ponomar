1 |  Now it came to pass in the thirtieth  year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, that I was in the  midst of the captivity by the river of Chobar; and the heavens were opened, and  I saw visions of God.   
2 |  On the fifth  day of the month; this was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joakim.   
3 |  And the word of the Lord came to  Jezekiel the priest, the son of Buzi, in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river  of Chobar; and the hand of the Lord was upon me.  
4 |  And I looked, and, behold, a sweeping  wind came from the north, and a great cloud on it, and <i>there was</i>  brightness round about it, and gleaming fire, and in the midst of it as it were  the appearance of amber in the midst of the fire, and brightness in it.     
5 |  And in the midst as it were the  likeness of four living creatures. And this was their appearance; the likeness  of a man was upon them.   
6 |  And each  one <i>had</i> four faces, and each one <i>had</i> four wings.    
7 |  And their legs were straight; and their  feet were winged, and <i>there were</i> sparks, like gleaming brass, and their  wings were light.   
8 |  And the hand of  a man was under their wings on their four sides.   
9 |   And the faces of them four turned not when they went; they went  everyone straight forward.   
10 |  And  the likeness of their faces was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the  right of the four; and the face of a calf on the left of the four; and the face  of an eagle to the four.   
11 |  And the  four had their wings spread out above; each one <i>had</i> two joined to one  another, and two covered their bodies.   
12 |   And each one went straight forward: wherever the spirit was going  they went, and turned not back.    
13 |  And in the midst of the living  creatures <i>there was</i> an appearance as of burning coals of fire, as an  appearance of lamps turning among the living creatures; and the brightness of  fire, and out of the fire came forth lightning.   
14   15    |  And I looked, and, behold, the  four <i>had each</i> one wheel on the ground near the living creatures.    
16 |  And the appearance of the wheels was as  the appearance of beryl: and the four had one likeness: and their work was as it  were a wheel in a wheel.   
17 |  They  went on their four sides: they turned not as they went;   
18 |  neither did their backs <i>turn</i>: and they were high:  and I beheld them, and the backs of them four were full of eyes round about.    
19 |  And when the living creatures went,  the wheels went by them: and when the living creatures lifted themselves off the  earth, the wheels were lifted off.   
20 |   Wherever the cloud happened to be, there was the spirit ready to  go: the wheels went and were lifted up with them; because the spirit of life was  in the wheels.   
21 |  When those went, <i>the wheels</i> went; and when those stood, <i>the wheels</i> stood; and when  those lifted themselves off the earth, they were lifted off with them: for the  spirit of life was in the wheels.    
22 |  And the likeness over the heads of  the living creatures was as a firmament, as the appearance of crystal, spread  out over their wings above.   
23 |  And  their wings were spread out under the firmament, reaching one to the other; two <i>wings</i> to each, covering their bodies.   
24 |   And I heard the sound of their wings when they went, as the sound  of much water: and when they stood, their wings were let down.    
25 |  And lo! a voice from above the  firmament  
 26 |  that was over their  head, <i>there was</i> as the appearance of a sapphire stone, <i>and</i> the  likeness of a throne upon it: and upon the likeness of the throne was the  likeness as an appearance of a man above.   
27 |   And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber from the appearance  of the loins and upwards, and from the appearance of the loins and under I saw  an appearance of fire, and the brightness thereof round about.    
28 |  As the appearance of the bow when it is  in the cloud in days of rain, so was the form of brightness round about.  Chapter  2

1 |  This was the appearance of the  likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw and fell upon my face, and heard  the voice of one speaking: and he said to me, Son of man, stand upon thy feet,  and I will speak to thee.   
2 |  And the  Spirit came upon me, and took me up, and raised me, and set me on my feet: and I  heard him speaking to me.   
3 |  And he  said to me, Son of Man, I send thee forth to the house of Israel, them that  provoke me; who have provoked me, they and their fathers to this day.    
4 |  And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith  the Lord.   
5 |  Whether then indeed they  shall hear or fear, (for it is a provoking house,) yet they shall know that thou  art a prophet in the midst of them.  
6 |  And thou, son of man, fear them not,  nor be dismayed at their face; (for they will madden and will rise up against  thee round about, and thou dwellest in the midst of scorpions): be not afraid of  their words, nor be dismayed at their countenance, for it is a provoking house.   
7 |  And thou shalt speak my words to  them, whether they will hear or fear: for it is a provoking house.    
8 |  And thou, son of man, hear him that  speaks to thee; be not thou provoking, as the provoking house: open thy mouth,  and eat what I give thee.   
9 |  And I  looked, and behold, a hand stretched out to me, and in it a volume of a book.   
10 |  And he unrolled it before me: and  in it the front and the back were written <i>upon</i>: and there was written <i> in it</i> Lamentation, and mournful song, and woe.  Chapter  3  

#3
1 |  And he said to me, Son of Man, eat  this volume, and go and speak to the children of Israel.   
2 |  So he opened my mouth, and caused me to eat the volume.    And he said to me, Son of man,   
3 |   thy mouth shall eat, and thy belly shall be filled with this  volume that is given to thee. So I ate it; and it was in my mouth as sweet as  honey.    
4 |  And he said to me, Son of man, go thy  way, and go in to the house of Israel, and speak my words to them.    
5 |  For thou art not sent to a people of hard  speech, <i>but</i> to the house of Israel;   
6 |   neither to many nations of other speech and other tongues, nor of  harsh language, whose words thou wouldest not understand: although if I <i>had</i>  sent thee to such, they would have hearkened to thee.   
7 |  But the house of Israel will not be willing to hearken to  thee; for they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are stubborn  and hard-hearted.   
8 |  And, behold, I  have made thy face strong against their faces, and I will strengthen thy power  against their power.   
9 |  And it shall  be continually stronger than a rock: be not afraid of them, neither be dismayed  at their faces, because it is a provoking house.    
10 |  And he said to me, Son of man,  receive into thine heart all the words that I have spoken to thee, and hear <i> them</i> with thine ears.   
11 |  And go  thy way, go in to the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt  speak to them, and say to them, Thus saith the Lord; whether they will hear, <i> or</i> whether they will forbear.    
12 |  Then the Spirit took me up, and I  heard behind me the voice <i>as</i> of a great earthquake, <i>saying</i>,  Blessed <i>be</i> the glory of the Lord from his place.   
13 |  And I perceived the sound of the wings of the living  creatures clapping one to the other, and the sound of the wheels was near them,  and the sound of the earthquake.   
14 |   And the Spirit lifted me, and took me up, and I went in the impulse of my  spirit; and the hand of the Lord was mighty upon me.    
15 |  Then I passed through the air and  came into the captivity, and went round <i>to</i> them that dwelt by the river  of Chobar who were there; and I sat there seven days, conversant in the midst of  them.  
16 |  And after the seven days the word of  the Lord came to me, saying, Son of man,   
17 |   I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel; and thou  shalt hear a word of my mouth, and shalt threaten them from me.    
18 |  When I say to the wicked, Thou shalt  surely die; and thou hast not warned him, to give warning to the wicked, to turn  from his ways, that he should live; that wicked man shall die in his iniquity;  but his blood will I require at thy hand.   
19 |   But if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedness,  and from his way, that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, and thou shalt  deliver thy soul.    
20 |  And when the righteous turns away  from his righteousness, and commits a trespass, and I shall bring punishment  before him, he shall die, because thou didst not warn him: he shall even die in  his sins, because his righteousness shall not be remembered; but his blood will  I require at thine hand.   
21 |  But if  thou warn the righteous not to sin, and he sin not, the righteous shall surely  live, because thou hast warned him; and thou shalt deliver thine own soul.  
22 |  And the hand of the Lord came upon  me; and he said to me, Arise, and go forth into the plain, and there shalt thou  be spoken to.    
23 |  And I arose, and went forth to the  plain: and, behold, the glory of the Lord stood there, according to the vision,  and according to the glory of the Lord, which I saw by the river of Chobar: and  I fell on my face.   
24 |  Then the  Spirit came upon me, and set me on my feet, and spoke to me, and said to me, Go  in, and shut thyself up in the midst of thine house.   
25 |  And thou, son of man, behold, bonds are prepared for thee,  and they shall bind thee with them, and thou shalt not come forth of the midst  of them.   
26 |  Also I will bind thy  tongue, and thou shalt be dumb, and shalt not be to them a reprover: because it  is a provoking house.   
27 |  But when I  speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the  Lord, He that hears, let him hear; and he that is disobedient, let him be  disobedient: because it is a provoking house.  Chapter  4

1 |  And thou, son of man, take thee a  brick, and thou shalt set it before thy face, and shalt portray on it the city, <i>even</i> Jerusalem.   
2 |  And thou  shalt besiege it, and build works against it, and throw up a mound round about  it, and pitch camps against it, and set up engines round about.    
3 |  And take thou to thyself an iron pan, and  thou shalt set it <i>for</i> an iron wall between thee and the city: and thou  shalt set thy face against it, and it shall be in a siege, and thou shalt  besiege it. This is a sign to the children of Israel.    
4 |  And thou shalt lie upon thy left side,  and lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number  of the hundred and fifty days <i>during</i> which thou shalt lie upon it: and  thou shalt bear their iniquities.   
5 |   For I have appointed thee their iniquities for a number of days, for a hundred  and ninety days: so thou shalt bear the iniquities of the house of Israel.   
6 |  And thou shalt accomplish this,  and <i>then</i> shalt lie on thy right side, and shalt bear the iniquities of  the house of Juda forty days: I have appointed thee a day for a year.     
7 |  So thou shalt set thy face to the  siege of Jerusalem, and shalt strengthen thine arm, and shalt prophesy against  it.   
8 |  And, behold, I have prepared  bonds for thee, land thou mayest not turn from thy one side to the other, until  the days of thy siege shall be accomplished.  
9 |  Take thou also to thee wheat, and  barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and bread-corn; and thou shalt cast  them into one earthen vessel, and shalt make them into loaves for thyself; and  thou shalt eat them a hundred and ninety days, according to the number of the  days <i>during</i> which thou sleepest on thy side.   
10 |  And thou shalt eat thy food by weight, twenty shekels a  day: from time to time shalt thou eat them.   
11 |   And thou shalt drink water by measure, even from time to time  thou shalt drink the sixth part of a hin.   
12 |   And thou shalt eat them <i>as</i> a barley cake: thou shalt bake  them before their eyes in man’s dung.    
13 |  And thou shalt say, Thus saith the  Lord God of Israel; Thus shall the children of Israel eat unclean things among  the Gentiles.   
14 |  Then I said, Not  so, Lord God of Israel: surely my soul has not been defiled with uncleanness;  nor have I eaten, that which died of itself or was torn of beasts from my birth  until now; neither has any corrupt flesh entered into my mouth.    
15 |  And he said to me, Behold, I have  given thee dung of oxen instead of man’s dung, and thou shalt prepare thy loaves  upon it.    
16 |  And he said to me, Son of man,  behold, I break the support of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by  weight and in want; and shall drink water by measure, and in a state of ruin:   
17 |  that they may want bread and  water; and a man and his brother shall be brought to ruin, and they shall pine  away in their iniquities.  Chapter  5

1 |  And thou, son of man, take thee a  sword sharper than a barber’s razor; thou shalt procure it for thyself, and  shalt bring it upon thine head, and upon thy beard: and thou shalt take a pair  of scales, and shalt separate the hair.   
2 |   A fourth part thou shalt burn in the fire in the midst of the  city, at the fulfillment of the days of the siege: and thou shalt take a fourth  part, and burn it up in the midst of it: and a fourth part thou shalt cut with a  sword round about it: and a fourth part thou shalt scatter to the wind; and I  will draw out a sword after them.    
3 |  And thou shalt take thence a few in  number, and shalt wrap them in the fold of thy garment.   
4 |  And thou shalt take of these again, and cast them into the  midst of the fire, and burn them up with fire: from thence shall come forth  fire; and thou shalt say to the whole house of Israel,  
5 |  Thus saith the Lord; This is  Jerusalem: I have set her and the countries round about her in the midst of the  nations.   
6 |  And thou shalt declare  mine ordinances to the lawless one from out of the nations; and my statutes <i> to the sinful one</i> of the countries round about her: because they have  rejected mine ordinances, and have not walked in my statutes.    
7 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord, Because  your occasion <i>for sin has been taken</i> from the nations round about you,  and ye have not walked in my statutes, nor kept mine ordinances, nay, ye have  not even done according to the ordinances of the nations round about you;  therefore thus saith the Lord;   
8 |   Behold, I am against thee, and I will execute judgment in the midst of thee in  the sight of the nations.   
9 |  And I  will do in thee things which I have not done, and the like of which I will not  do again, for all thine abominations.   
10 |   Therefore the fathers shall eat <i>their</i> children in the  midst of thee, and children shall eat <i>their</i> fathers; and I will execute  judgments in thee, and I will scatter all that are left of thee to every wind.    
11 |  Therefore, <i>as</i> I live, saith  the Lord; surely, because thou hast defiled my holy things with all thine  abominations, I also will reject thee; mine eye shall not spare, and I will have  no mercy.   
12 |  A fourth part of thee  shall be cut off by pestilence, and a fourth part of thee shall be consumed in  the midst of thee with famine: and <i>as for another</i> fourth part of thee, I  will scatter them to every wind; and a fourth part of thee shall fall by sword  round about thee, and I will draw out a sword after them.    
13 |  And my wrath and mine anger shall be  accomplished upon them: and thou shalt know that I the Lord have spoken in my  jealousy, when I have accomplished mine anger upon them.    
14 |  And I will make thee desolate, and  thy daughters round about thee, in the sight of every one that passes through.   
15 |  And thou shalt be mourned over  and miserable among the nations round about thee, when I have executed judgments  in thee in the vengeance of my wrath. I the Lord have spoken.    
16 |  And when I have sent against them shafts  of famine, then they shall be consumed, and I will break the strength of thy  bread.   
17 |  So I will send forth  against thee famine and evil beasts, and I will take vengeance upon thee; and  pestilence and blood shall pass through upon thee; and I will bring a sword upon  thee round about. I the Lord have spoken.  Chapter  6

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
2 |  Son of man, set thy face  against the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them;    
3 |  and thou shalt say,    Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord; thus saith  the Lord to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the valleys, and to the  forests; Behold, I bring a sword upon you, and your high places shall be utterly  destroyed.   
4 |  And your altars shall  be broken to pieces, and your consecrated plats; and I will cast down your slain <i>men</i> before your idols.   
5 |  And  I will scatter your bones round about your altars,   
6 |  and in all your habitations: the cities shall be made  desolate, and the high places utterly laid waste; that your altars may be  destroyed, and your idols be broken to pieces, and your consecrated plats be  abolished.   
7 |  And slain <i>men</i>  shall fall in the midst of you, and ye shall know that I am the Lord.  
8 |  When there are <i>some</i> of you  escaping from the sword among the Gentiles, and when ye are scattered in the  countries;   
9 |  then they of you that  escape among the nations whither they were carried captive shall remember me; (I  have sworn <i>an oath</i> against their heart that goes a-whoring from me, and  their eyes that go a-whoring after their practices;) and they shall mourn over  themselves for all their abominations.   
10 |   And they shall know that I the Lord have spoken.  
11 |  Thus saith the Lord; Clap with <i>thy</i>  hand, and stamp with <i>thy</i> foot and say, Aha, aha! for all the abominations  of the house of Israel: they shall fall by the sword, and by pestilence, and by  famine.   
12 |  He that is near shall  fall by the sword; and he that is far off shall die by the pestilence; and he  that is in the siege shall be consumed with famine: and I will accomplish mine  anger upon them.    
13 |  Then ye shall know that I am the  Lord, when your slain are in the midst of your idols round about your altars, on  every high hill, and under <i>every</i> shady tree, where they offered a sweet  savour to all their idols.   
14 |  And I  will stretch out my hand against them, and I will make the land desolate and  ruined from the wilderness of Deblatha, in all their habitations: <i>and</i> ye  shall know that I am the Lord.  Chapter  7

1 |  Moreover the word of the Lord came  to me, saying, Also, thou, son of man, say,   
2 |   Thus saith the Lord;    An end is come to the land of Israel, the end is come on the  four corners of the land.   
3 |  The end  is come on thee,   
7 |  the inhabitant of  the land: the time is come, the day has drawn nigh, not with tumult, nor with  pangs.   
8 |  Now I will pour out my  anger upon thee near at hand, and I will accomplish my wrath on thee: and I will  judge thee for thy ways, and recompense upon thee all thine abominations.&nbsp;   
9 |  Mine eye shall not spare, nor will  I have any mercy: for I will recompense thy ways upon thee, and thine  abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt know that I am the  Lord that smite <i>thee</i>.   
7|   Now  the end <i>is come</i> to thee, and I will send <i>judgment</i> upon thee: and I  will take vengeance on thy ways, and will recompense all thine abominations upon  thee.   
4 |  Mine eye shall not spare,  nor will I have any mercy: for I will recompense thy way upon thee, and thine  abominations shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt know that I am the  Lord.    
5 |  For thus saith the Lord; Behold, the  end is come.   
10 |  Behold, the day of the Lord! although  the rod has blossomed,   
11 |  pride has  sprung up, and will break the staff of the wicked one, and <i>that</i> not with  tumult, nor with haste.   
12 |  The time  is come, behold the day: let not the buyer rejoice, and let not the seller  mourn.   
13 |  For the buyer shall never  again return to the seller, neither shall a man cleave with the eye <i>of hope</i>  to his life.   
14 |  Sound ye the  trumpet, and pass sentence on all together.   
15 |   <i>There shall be</i> war with the sword without, and famine and  pestilence within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword; and famine  and pestilence shall destroy them that are in the city.  
16 |  But they that escape of them shall be  delivered, and shall be upon the mountains: and I will slay all <i>the rest</i>,  every one for his iniquities.   
17 |  All  hands shall be completely weakened, and all thighs shall be defiled with  moisture.   
18 |  And they shall gird  themselves with sackcloth, and amazement shall cover them; and shame shall be  upon them, <i>even</i> upon every face, and baldness upon every head.    
19 |  Their silver shall be cast forth in the  streets, and their gold shall be despised: their souls shall not be satisfied,  and their bellies shall not be filled: for it was the punishment of their  iniquities.   
20 |  <i>As for</i> their  choice ornaments, they employed them for pride, and they made of them images of  their abominations: therefore have I made them uncleanness to them.    
21 |  And I will deliver them into the  hands of strangers to make them a prey, and to the pests of the earth for a  spoil; and they shall profane them.   
22 |   And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall defile my  charge, and shall go in to them unguardedly, and profane them.    
23 |  And they shall work uncleanness: because  the land is full of strange nations, and the city is full of iniquity.    
24 |  And I will turn back the boasting of  their strength; and their holy things shall be defiled.   
25 |  And <i>though</i> propitiation shall come, and <i>one</i>  shall seek peace, yet there shall be none.   
26 |   There shall be woe upon woe, and there shall be message upon  message; and a vision shall be sought from a prophet; but the law shall perish  from the priest, and counsel from the elders.   
27 |   The prince shall clothe himself with desolation, and the hands of  the people of the land shall be made feeble: I will do to them according to  their ways, and according to their judgments will I punish them; and they shall  know that I am the Lord.  Chapter  8

1 |  &nbsp;And it came to pass in the sixth  year, in the fifth month, on the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, I was sitting in  the house, and the elders of Juda were sitting before me: and the hand of the  Lord came upon me.   
2 |  And I looked,  and, behold, the likeness of a man: from his loins and downwards <i>there was</i>  fire, and from his loins upwards <i>there was</i> as the appearance of amber.   
3 |  And he stretched forth the  likeness of a hand, and took me by the crown of my head; and the Spirit lifted  me up between the earth and sky, and brought me to Jerusalem in a vision of God,  to the porch of the gate that looks to the north, where was the pillar of the  Purchaser.   
4 |  And, behold, the glory  of the Lord God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I saw in the  plain.    
5 |  And he said to me, Son of man, lift up  thine eyes toward the north. So I lifted up mine eyes toward the north, and,  behold, <i>I looked</i> from the north toward the eastern gate.    
6 |  And he said to me, Son of man, hast thou  seen what these do? They commit great abominations here so that I should keep  away from my sanctuary: and thou shalt see yet greater iniquities.  
7 |  And he brought me to the porch of the  court.   
8 |  And he said to me, Son of  man, dig: so I dug, and behold a door.   
9 |   And he said to me, Go in, and behold the iniquities which they  practise here.   
10 |  So I went in and  looked; and beheld vain abominations, and all the idols of the house of Israel,  portrayed upon them round about.   
11 |   And seventy men of the elders of the house of Israel, and Jechonias the son of  Saphan stood in their presence in the midst of them, and each one held his  censer in his hand; and the smoke of the incense went up.   
 12 |  And he said to me, Thou hast seen, son of man, what the  elders of the house of Israel do, each one of them in their secret chamber:  because they have said, The Lord see not; The Lord has forsaken the earth.  
13 |  And he said to me, Thou shalt see yet  greater iniquities which these do.   
14 |   And he brought me in to the porch of the house of the Lord that  looks to the north; and, behold <i>there were</i> women sitting there lamenting  for Thammuz.   
15 |  And he said to me,  Son of man, thou hast seen; but thou shalt yet see <i>evil</i> practices greater  then these.    
16 |  And he brought me into the inner  court of the house of the Lord, and at the entrance of the temple of the Lord,  between the porch and the altar, were about twenty men, with their back parts  toward the temple of the Lord, and their faces <i>turned</i> the opposite way;  and these were worshipping the sun.   
17 |   And he said to me, Son of man, thou hast seen this. <i>Is it</i>  a little thing to the house of Juda to practise the iniquities which they have  practised here? for they have filled the land with iniquity: and, behold, these  are as scorners.   
18 |  Therefore will I  deal with them in wrath: mine eye shall not spare, nor will I have any mercy.  Chapter  9

1 |  And he cried in mine ears with a  loud voice, saying, The judgment of the city has drawn nigh; and each had the  weapons of destruction in his hand.   
2 |   And, behold, six men came from the way of the high gate that  looks toward the north, and each one’s axe was in his hand; and there was one  man in the midst of them clothed with a long robe down to the feet, and a  sapphire girdle was on his loins: and they came in and stood near the brazen  altar.   
3 |  And the glory of the God of  Israel, that was upon them, went up from the cherubs to the porch of the house.    And he called the man that was clothed with the long robe, who  had the girdle on his loins;   
4 |  And  said to him, Go through the midst of Jerusalem, and set a mark on the foreheads  of the men that groan and that grieve for all the iniquities that are done in  the midst of them.   
5 |  And he said to  the first in my hearing, Go after him into the city, and smite: and let not your  eyes spare, and have no mercy.   
6 |   Slay utterly old man and youth, and virgin, and infants, and women: but go ye  not nigh any on whom is the mark: begin at my sanctuary.    So they began with the elder men who were within in the house.   
7 |  And he said to them, Defile the  house, and go out and fill the ways with dead bodies, and smite.    
8 |  And it came to pass as they were  smiting, that I fell upon my face, and cried out, and said, Alas, O Lord! wilt  thou destroy the remnant of Israel, in pouring out thy wrath upon Jerusalem?   
9 |  Then said he to me, The iniquity  of the house of Israel and Juda is become very exceedingly great: for the land  is filled with many nations, and the city is filled with iniquity and  uncleanness: because they have said, The Lord has forsaken the earth, The Lord  looks not upon <i>it</i>.   
10 |   Therefore mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have any mercy: I have  recompensed their ways upon their heads.    
11 |  And, behold, the man clothed with the  long robe, and girt with the girdle about his loins, answered and said, I have  done as thou didst command me.  Chapter  10

1 |  Then I looked, and, behold, over  the firmament that was above the head of the cherubs <i>there was</i> a likeness  of a throne over them, as a sapphire stone.   
2 |   And he said to the man clothed with the <i>long</i> robe, Go in  between the wheels that are under the cherubs, and fill thine hands with coals  of fire from between the cherubs, and scatter <i>them</i> over the city. And he  went in my sight.    
3 |  And the cherubs stood on the right  hand of the house, as the man went in; and the cloud filled the inner court.   
4 |  Then the glory of the Lord  departed from the cherubs to the porch of the house; and the cloud filled the  house, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord.   
5 |  And the sound of the cherubs’  wings was heard as far as the outer court, as the voice of the Almighty God  speaking.    
6 |  And it came to pass, when he gave a  charge to the man clothed with the sacred robe, saying, Take fire from between  the wheels from between the cherubs, that he went in, and stood near the wheels.   
7 |  And he stretched forth his hand  into the midst of the fire that was between the cherubs, and took <i>thereof</i>,  and put <i>it</i> into the hands of the man clothed with the sacred robe: and he  took <i>it</i>, and went out.  
8 |  And I saw the cherubs <i>having</i>  the likeness of men’s hands under their wings.   
9 |   And I saw, and behold, four wheels stood by the cherubs, one  wheel by each cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was as the appearance of  a carbuncle stone.   
10 |  And <i>as for</i>  their appearance, <i>there was</i> one likeness to the four, as if there should  be a wheel in the midst of a wheel.   
11 |   When they went, they went on their four sides; they turned not  when they went, for whichever way the first head looked, they went; and they  turned not as they went.   
12 |  And  their backs, and their hands, and their wings, and the wheels, were full of eyes  round about the four wheels.   
13 |  And  these wheels were called Gelgel in my hearing.   
14 15 |  And the cherubs were the same living creature which I saw  by the river of Chobar.    
16 |  And when the cherubs went, the wheels  went, and they were close to them: and when the cherubs lifted up their wings to  mount up from the earth, their wheels turned not.   
17 |  When they stood, <i>the wheels</i> stood; and when they  mounted up, <i>the wheels</i> mounted up with them: because the spirit of life  was in them.    
18 |  Then the glory of the Lord departed  from the house, and went up on the cherubs.   
19 |   And the cherubs lifted up their wings, and mounted up from the  earth in my sight: when they went forth, the wheels were also beside them, and  they stood at the entrance of the front gate of the house of the Lord; and the  glory of the God of Israel was upon them above.    
20 |  This is the living creature which I  saw under the God of Israel by the river of Chobar; and I knew that they were  cherubs.   
21 |  Each one <i>had</i> four  faces, and each one <i>had</i> eight wings; and under their wings was the  likeness of men’s hands.   
22 |  And <i> as for</i> the likeness of their faces, these are the <i>same</i> faces which I  saw under the glory of the God of Israel by the river of Chobar: and they went  each straight forward.  Chapter  11

1 |  Moreover the Spirit took me up, and  brought me to the front gate of the house of the Lord, that looks eastward: and  behold at the entrance of the gate were about five and twenty men; and I saw in  the midst of them Jechonias the son of Ezer, and Phaltias the son of Banaeas,  the leaders of the people.    
2 |  And the Lord said to me, Son of man,  these are the men that devise vanities, and take evil counsel in this city:   
3 |  who say, Have not the houses been  newly built? This is the caldron, and we are the flesh.   
4 |  Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, son of man.   
5 |  And the Spirit of the Lord fell  upon me, and said to me, say;    Thus saith the Lord; Thus have ye said, O house of Israel: and  I know the devices of your spirit.   
6 |   Ye have multiplied your dead in this city, and ye have filled  your ways with slain men.   
7 |   Therefore thus saith the Lord; Your dead whom ye have smitten in the midst of  it, these are the flesh, and this<i> city</i> is the caldron: but I will bring  you forth out of the midst of it.   
8 |   Ye fear the sword; and I will bring a sword upon you, saith the Lord.    
9 |  And I will bring you forth out of the  midst of it, and will deliver you into the hands of strangers, and will execute  judgments among you.   
10 |  Ye shall  fall by the sword; I will judge you on the mountains of Israel; and ye shall  know that I am the Lord.    
11 |  And it came to pass, while I was  prophesying, that Phaltias the son of Banaeas died. And I fell upon my face, and  cried with a loud voice, and said, Alas, alas, O Lord! wilt thou utterly destroy  the remnant of Israel?   
14 |  And the  word of the Lord came to me, saying,   
15 |   Son of man, thy brethren, and the men of thy captivity, and all  the house of Israel are come to the full, to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem  said, Keep ye far away from the Lord: the land is given to us for an  inheritance.   
16 |  Therefore say thou,    Thus saith the Lord; I will cast them off among the nations,  and will disperse them into every land, yet will I be to them for a little  sanctuary in the countries which they shall enter.   
17 |  Therefore say thou, Thus saith the Lord; I will also take  them from the heathen, and gather them out of the lands wherein I have scattered  them, and will give them the land of Israel.    
18 |  And they shall enter in there, and  shall remove all the abominations of it, and all its iniquities from it.    
19 |  And I will give them another heart, and  will put a new spirit within them; and will extract the heart of stone from  their flesh, and give them a heart of flesh:   
20 |   that they may walk in my commandments, and keep mine ordinances,  and do them: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a God.    
21 |  And as for the heart <i>set upon</i>  their abominations and their iniquities, as their heart went <i>after them</i>,  I have recompensed their ways on their heads, saith the Lord.  
22 |  Then the cherubs lifted up their  wings, and the wheels beside them; and the glory of the God of Israel was over  them above.   
23 |  And the glory of the  Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood on the mountain which was in  front of the city.    
24 |  And the Spirit took me up, and  brought me to the land of the Chaldeans, to the captivity, in a vision by the  Spirit of God: and I went up after the vision which I saw.    
25 |  And I spoke to the captivity all the  words of the Lord which he had shewed me.  Chapter  12  

#12
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, thou  dwellest in the midst of the iniquities of those, who have eyes to see, and see  not; and have ears to hear, and hear not: because it is a provoking house.    
3 |  Thou therefore, son of man, prepare  thyself baggage for going into captivity by day in their sight; and thou shalt  be led into captivity from thy place into another place in their sight; that  they may see that it is a provoking house.   
4 |   And thou shalt carry forth thy baggage, baggage for captivity, by  day before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth at even, as a captive goes forth,  in their sight.   
5 |  Dig for thyself  into the wall <i>of the house</i>, and thou shalt pass through it in their  sight:   
6 |  thou shalt be lifted up on <i>men’s</i> shoulders, and shalt go forth in secret: thou shalt cover thy face,  and shalt not see the ground: because I have made thee a sign to the house of  Israel.    
7 |  And I did thus according to all that  he commanded me; and I carried forth my baggage for captivity by day, and in the  evening I dug through the wall for myself, and went out secretly; I was taken up  on <i>men’s</i> shoulders before them.   
8 |   And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying,   
9 |  Son of man, have not the house of  Israel, the provoking house, said to thee, What doest thou?    
10 |  Say to them,    Thus saith the Lord God, the Prince and the Ruler in Israel,  even to all the house of Israel who are in the midst of them:    
11 |  say, I am performing signs: as I have  done, so shall it be to him: they shall go into banishment and captivity.    
12 |  And the prince in the midst of them  shall be borne upon shoulders, and shall go forth in secret through the wall,  and shall dig so that he may go forth thereby: he shall cover his face, that he  may not be seen by <i>any</i> eye, and he himself shall not see the ground.   
13 |  And I will spread out my net upon  him, and he shall be caught in my toils: and I will bring him to Babylon to the  land of the Chaldeans; but he shall not see it, though he shall die there.   
14 |  And I will scatter to every wind  all his assistants round about him, and all that help him; and I will draw out a  sword after them;    
15 |  And they shall know that I am the  Lord, when I have scattered them among the nations; and I will disperse them in  the countries.    
16 |  And I will leave of them <i>a few</i>  men in number <i>spared</i> from the sword, and from famine, and pestilence;  that they may declare all their iniquities among the nations whither they have  gone; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  
17 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
18 |  Son of man, eat thy bread  with sorrow, and drink <i>thy</i> water with torment and affliction.    
19 |  And thou shalt say to the people of the  land, Thus saith the Lord to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, on the land of  Israel; They shall eat their bread in scarcity, and shall drink their water in  desolation, that the land may be desolate with all that it contains: for all  that dwell in it are ungodly.   
20 |  And  their inhabited cities shall be laid utterly waste, and the land shall be  desolate; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.  
21 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
22 |  Son of man, what is your  parable on the land of Israel, that ye say, The days are long, the vision has  perished?   
23 |  Therefore say to them,    Thus saith the Lord; I will even set aside this parable, and  the house of Israel shall no more at all use this parable: for thou shalt say to  them, The days are at hand, and the import of every vision.    
24 |  For there shall no more be any false  vision, nor any one prophesying flatteries in the midst of the children of  Israel.   
25 |  For I the Lord will speak  my words; I will speak and perform <i>them</i>, and will no more delay, for in  your days, O provoking house, I will speak the word, and will perform <i>it</i>,  saith the Lord.    
26 |  Moreover the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
27 |  Son of man, behold,  the provoking house of Israel boldly say, The vision which this man sees is for  many days, and he prophesies for times afar off.   
28 |   Therefore say to them, Thus saith the Lord; Henceforth none of my  words shall linger, which I shall speak: I will speak and do, saith the Lord.  Chapter  13  

#13
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, prophesy  against the prophets of Israel, and thou shalt prophesy, and shalt say to them,  Hear ye the word of the Lord:    
3 |  Thus saith the Lord, Woe to them that  prophesy out of their own heart, and who see nothing at all.    
4 |  Thy prophets, O Israel, are like foxes in  the deserts.   
5 |  They have not  continued steadfast, and they have gathered flocks against the house of Israel,  they that say,   
6 |  In the day of the  Lord, have not stood, seeing false <i>visions</i>, prophesying vanities, who  say, The Lord saith, and the Lord has not sent them, and they began <i>to try</i>  to confirm the word.   
7 |  Have ye not  seen a false vision? and spoken vain prophecies?   
8 |   And therefore say,    Thus saith the Lord; Because your words are false, and your  prophecies are vain, therefore, behold, I am against you, saith the Lord.    
9 |  And I will stretch forth my hand against  the prophets that see false <i>visions</i>, and those that utter vanities: they  shall not partake of the instruction of my people, neither shall they be written  in the roll of the house of Israel, and they shall not enter into the land of  Israel; and they shall know that I am the Lord.   
10 |   Because they have caused my people to err, saying, Peace; and  there is no peace; and one builds a wall, and they plaster it, —it shall fall.    
11 |  Say to them that plaster <i>it</i>,  It shall fall; and there shall be a flooding rain; and I will send great stones  upon their joinings, and they shall fall; and there shall be a sweeping wind,  and it shall be broken.   
12 |  And lo!  the wall has fallen; and will they not say to you, Where is your plaster  wherewith ye plastered <i>it</i>?   
13 |   Therefore thus saith the Lord; I will even cause to burst forth a  sweeping blast with fury, and there shall be a flooding rain in my wrath; and in <i>my</i> fury I will bring on great stones for complete destruction.    
14 |  And I will break down the wall which ye  have plastered, and it shall fall; and I will lay it on the ground, and its  foundations shall be discovered, and it shall fall; and ye shall be consumed  with rebukes: and ye shall know that I am the Lord.    
15 |  And I will accomplish my wrath upon  the wall, and upon them that plaster it; it shall fall: and I said to you, The  wall is not, nor they that plaster it,   
16 |   even the prophets of Israel, who prophesy concerning Jerusalem,  and who see <i>visions of</i> peace for her, and there is no peace, saith the  Lord.   
17 |  And thou, son of man, set  thy face firmly against the daughters of thy people, that prophesy out of their  own heart; and prophesy against them.   
18 |   And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Woe to the <i>women</i>  that sew pillows under every elbow, and make kerchiefs on the head of every  stature to pervert souls! The souls of my people are perverted, and they have  saved souls alive.   
19 |  And they have  dishonoured me before my people for a handful of barley, and for pieces of  bread, to slay the souls which should not die, and to save alive the souls which  should not live, while ye speak to a people hearing vain speeches.    
20 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord God,  Behold, I am against your pillows, whereby ye there confound souls, and I will  tear them away from your arms, and will set at liberty their souls which ye  pervert to scatter them.   
21 |  And I  will tear your kerchiefs, and will rescue my people out of your hands, and they  shall no longer be in your hands to be confounded; and ye shall know that I am  the Lord.    
22 |  Because ye have perverted the heart  of the righteous, whereas I perverted him not, and <i>that</i> in order to  strengthen the hands of the wicked, that he should not at all turn from his evil  way and live:   
23 |  therefore ye shall  not see false <i>visions</i>, and ye shall no more utter prophecies: but I will  deliver my people out of your hand; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.  Chapter  14  

#14
1 |  And there came to me men of the  people of Israel, of the elders, and sat before me.   
2 |  And the word of the Lord came to me, saying,    
3 |  Son of man, these men have conceived  their devices in their hearts, and have set before their faces the punishment of  their iniquities: shall I indeed answer them?   
4 |   Therefore speak to them, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith  the Lord; Any man of the house of Israel, who shall conceive his devices in his  heart, and shall set the punishment of his iniquity before his face, and shall  come to the prophet; I the Lord will answer him <i>according to the things</i>  in which his mind is entangled,   
5 |   that he should turn aside the house of Israel, according to their hearts that  are estranged from me in their thoughts.    
6 |  Therefore say to the house of Israel,  Thus saith the Lord God, Be converted, and turn from your <i>evil</i> practices,  and from all your sins, and turn your faces back again.   
7 |  For any man of the house of Israel, or of the strangers  that sojourn in Israel, who shall separate himself from me, and conceive his  imaginations in his heart, and set before his face the punishment of his  iniquity, and come to the prophet to enquire of him concerning me; I the Lord  will answer him, <i>according to the things</i> wherein he is entangled.    
8 |  And I will set my face against that man,  and will make him desolate and ruined, and will cut him off from the midst of my  people; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.    
9 |  And if a prophet should cause to err  and should speak, I the Lord have caused that prophet to err, and will stretch  out my hand upon him, and will utterly destroy him from the midst of my people  Israel.   
10 |  And they shall bear their  iniquity according to the trespass of him that asks; and it shall be in like  manner to the prophet according to the trespass:   
11 |   that the house of Israel may no more go astray from me, and that  they may no more defile themselves with any of their transgressions: so shall  they be my people, and I will be their God, saith the Lord.  
12 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
13 |  Son of man, if a land  shall sin against me by committing a trespass, then will I stretch out my hand  upon it, and will break its staff of bread, and will send forth famine upon it,  and cut off from it man and beast.   
14 |   And though these three men should be in the midst of it, Noe, and  Daniel, and Job, they <i>alone</i> should be delivered by their righteousness,  saith the Lord.    
15 |  If again I bring evil beasts upon the  land, and take vengeance upon it, and it be ruined, and there be no one to pass  through for fear of the wild beasts:   
16 |   and <i>if</i> these three men should be in the midst of it, <i>as</i>  I live, saith the Lord, neither sons nor daughters shall be saved, but these  only shall be saved, and the land shall be destroyed.   
17 |  Or again if I bring a sword upon that land, and say, Let  the sword go through the land; and I cut off from them man and beast:    
18 |  though these three men were in the midst  of it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall not deliver sons or daughters, but  they only shall be saved themselves.    
19 |  Or <i>if</i> again I send pestilence  upon that land, and pour out my wrath upon it in blood, to destroy from off it  man and beast:   
20 |  and should Noe,  and Daniel, and Job, be in the midst of it, <i>as</i> I live, saith the Lord,  there shall be left <i>them</i> neither sons nor daughters; <i>only</i> they by  their righteousness shall deliver their souls.    
21 |  Thus saith the Lord, And if I even  send upon Jerusalem my four sore judgments, sword, and famine, and evil beasts,  and pestilence, to destroy from out of it man and beast;   
 22 |  yet, behold, <i>there shall be</i> men left in it, the  escaped thereof, who <i>shall</i> lead forth of it sons and daughters: behold,  they <i>shall</i> go forth to you, and ye shall see their ways and their  thoughts: and ye shall mourn over the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem, <i>even</i> all the evils which I have brought upon it.   
23 |  And they shall comfort you, because ye shall see their  ways and their thoughts: and ye shall know that I have not done in vain all that  I have done in it, saith the Lord.   Chapter  15     

#15
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,    
2 |  And thou, son of man—of all the wood,  of the branches that are among the trees of the forest, what shall be made of  the wood of the vine?   
3 |  Will they  take wood of it to make <i>it fit</i> for work? will they take of it a peg to  hang any vessel upon it?   
4 |  It is  only given to the fire to be consumed; the fire consumes that which is yearly  pruned of it, and it is utterly gone. Will it be useful for <i>any</i> work?   
5 |  Not even while it is yet whole  will it be <i>useful</i> for <i>any</i> work: if the fire shall have utterly  consumed it, will it still be <i>fit</i> for work?   
6 |  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord, As the vine-tree among  the trees of the forest, which I have given up to the fire to be consumed, so  have I given up the inhabitants of Jerusalem.   
7 |   And I will set my face against them; they shall go forth of the  fire, and <i>yet</i> fire shall devour them; and they shall know that I am the  Lord, when I have set my face against them.   
8 |   And I will give up the land to ruin, because they have utterly  transgressed, saith the Lord.   Chapter  16     

#16
1 |  Moreover the word of the Lord came  to me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, testify  to Jerusalem <i>of</i> her iniquities;   
3 |   and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord to Jerusalem; Thy root  and thy birth are of the land of Chanaan: thy father was an Amorite, and thy  mother a Chettite.   
4 |  And <i>as for</i>  thy birth in the day wherein thou wast born, thou didst not bind thy breasts,  and thou wast not washed in water, neither wast thou salted with salt, neither  wast thou swathed in swaddling-bands.   
5 |   Nor did mine eye pity thee, to do for thee one of all these  things, to feel at all for thee; but thou wast cast out on the face of the  field, because of the deformity of thy person, in the day wherein thou wast  born.  
6 |  And I passed by to thee, and saw thee  polluted in thy blood; and I said to thee, <i>Let there be</i> life out of thy  blood:   
7 |  increase; I have made thee  as the springing grass of the field. So thou didst increase and grow, and didst  enter into great cities: thy breasts were set, and thy hair grew, whereas thou  wast naked and bare.    
8 |  And I passed by thee and saw thee,  and, behold, <i>it was</i> thy time and a time of resting; and I spread my wings  over thee, and covered thy shame, and swear to thee: and I entered into covenant  with thee, saith the Lord, and thou becamest mine.   
9 |  And I washed thee in water, and washed thy blood from  thee, and anointed thee with oil.   
10 |   And I clothed thee with embroidered <i>garments</i>, and clothed  thee beneath with purple, and girded thee with fine linen, and clothed thee with  silk,   
11 |  and decked thee also with  ornaments, and put bracelets on thine hands, and a necklace on thy neck.    
12 |  And I put a pendant on thy nostril, and  rings in thine ears, and a crown of glory on thine head.   
 13 |  So thou wast adorned with gold and silver; and thy  raiment was of fine linen, and silk, and variegated work: thou didst eat fine  flour, and oil, and honey, and didst become extremely beautiful.    
14 |  And thy name went forth among the  nations for thy beauty: because it was perfected with elegance, <i>and</i> in  the comeliness which I put upon thee, saith the Lord.  
15 |  Thou didst trust in thy beauty, and  didst go a-whoring because of thy renown, and didst pour out thy fornication on  every passer by.   
16 |  And thou didst  take of thy garments, and madest to thyself idols of needlework, and didst go  a-whoring after them; therefore thou shalt never come in, nor shall <i>the like</i>  take place.   
17 |  And thou tookest thy  fair ornaments of my gold and of my silver, of what I gave thee, and thou madest  to thyself male images, and thou didst commit whoredom with them.    
18 |  And thou didst take thy variegated  apparel and didst clothe them, and thou didst set before them mine oil and mine  incense.   
19 |  And <i>thou tookest</i>  my bread which I gave thee, (<i>yea</i> I fed thee with fine flour and oil and  honey) and didst set them before them for a sweet-smelling savour: yea, it was  so, saith the Lord.    
20 |  And thou tookest thy sons and thy  daughters, whom thou borest, and didst sacrifice <i>these</i> to them to be  destroyed. Thou didst go a-whoring as <i>if that were</i> little,    
21 |  and didst slay thy children, and gavest  them up in offering them to them for an expiation.   
22 |  This is beyond all thy fornication, and thou didst not  remember thine infancy, when thou wast naked and bare, <i>and</i> didst live <i> though</i> defiled in thy blood.    
23 |  And it came to pass after all thy  wickedness, saith the Lord,   
24 |  that  thou didst build thyself a house of fornication, and didst make thyself a public  place in every street;   
25 |  and on the  head of every way thou didst set up thy fornications, and didst defile thy  beauty, and didst open thy feet to every passer by, and didst multiply thy  fornication.   
26 |  And thou didst go  a-whoring after the children of Egypt thy neighbors, great of flesh; and didst  go a-whoring, often to provoke me to anger.    
27 |  And if I stretch out my hand against  thee, then will I abolish thy statutes, and deliver <i>thee</i> up to the wills  of them that hate thee, <i>even to</i> the daughters of the Philistines that  turned thee aside from the way wherein thou sinned.    
28 |  And thou didst go a-whoring to the  daughters of Assur, and not even thus wast thou satisfied; yea, thou didst go  a-whoring, and wast not satisfied.   
29 |   And thou didst multiply thy covenants with the land of the  Chaldeans; and not even with these wast thou satisfied.    
30 |  Why should I make a covenant with thy  daughter, saith the Lord, while thou doest all these things, the works of a  harlot? and thou hast gone a-whoring in a threefold degree with thy daughters.   
31 |  Thou hast built a house of  harlotry in every top of a way, and hast set up thine high place in every  street; and thou didst become as a harlot gathering hires.    
32 |  An adulteress resembles thee, taking  rewards of her husband.   
33 |  She has  even given rewards to all that went a-whoring after her, and thou hast given  rewards to all thy lovers, yea, thou didst load them with rewards, that they  should come to thee from every side for thy fornication.    
34 |  And there has happened in thee  perverseness in thy fornication beyond <i>other</i> women, and they have  committed fornication with thee, in that thou givest hires over and above, and  hires were not given to thee; and <i>thus</i> perverseness happened in thee.  
35 |  Therefore, harlot, hear the word of  the Lord:   
36 |  Thus saith the Lord,  Because thou hast poured forth thy money, therefore thy shame shall be  discovered in thy harlotry with thy lovers, and <i>with</i> regard to all the  imaginations of thine iniquities, and for the blood of thy children which thou  hast given to them.   
37 |  Therefore,  behold, I <i>will</i> gather all thy lovers with whom thou hast consorted, and  all whom thou hast loved, with all whom thou didst hate; and I will gather them  against thee round about, and will expose thy wickedness to them, and they shall  see all thy shame.   
38 |  And I will be  avenged on thee with the vengeance of an adulteress, and I will bring upon thee  blood of fury and jealousy.   
39 |  And I  will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall break down thy house of  harlotry, and destroy thine high place; and they shall strip thee of thy  garments, and shall take thy proud ornaments, and leave thee naked and bare.   
40 |  And they shall bring multitudes  upon thee, and they shall stone thee with stones, and pierce thee with their  swords.   
41 |  And they shall burn thine  houses with fire, and shall execute vengeance on thee in the sight of many  women: and I will turn thee back from harlotry, and I will no more give <i>thee</i>  rewards.    
42 |  So will I slacken my fury against  thee, and my jealousy shall be removed from thee, and I will rest, and be no  more careful <i>for thee</i>.   
43 |   Because thou didst not remember thine infancy, and thou didst grieve me in all  these things; therefore, behold, I have recompensed thy ways upon thine head,  saith the Lord: for thus hast thou wrought ungodliness above all thine <i>other</i>  iniquities.  
44 |  These are all the things they have  spoken against thee in a proverb, saying,   
45 |   As is the mother, so is thy mother’s daughter: thou art she that  has rejected her husband and her children; and the sisters of thy sisters have  rejected their husbands and their children: your mother was a Chettite, and <i> your</i> father an Amorite.   
46 |  Your  elder sister who dwells on thy left hand is Samaria, she and her daughters: and  thy younger sister, that dwells on the right hand, is Sodom and her daughters.   
47 |  Yet notwithstanding thou hast not  walked in their ways, neither hast thou done according to their iniquities  within a little, but thou hast exceeded them in all thy ways.    
48 |  <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord,  this Sodom and her daughters have not done as thou and thy daughters have done.   
49 |  Moreover this was the sin of thy  sister Sodom, pride: she and her daughters lived in pleasure, in fullness of  bread <i>and</i> in abundance: this belonged to her and her daughters, and they  helped not the hand of the poor and needy.   
50 |   And they boasted, and wrought iniquities before me: so I cut them  off as I saw <i>fit</i>.    
51 |  Also Samaria has not sinned according  to half of thy sins; but thou hast multiplied thine iniquities beyond them, and  thou hast justified thy sisters in all thine iniquities which thou hast  committed.   
52 |  Thou therefore bear  thy punishment, for that thou hast corrupted thy sisters by thy sins which thou  hast committed beyond them; and thou hast made them <i>appear</i> more righteous  than thyself: thou therefore be ashamed, and bear thy dishonour, in that thou  hast justified thy sisters.   
53 |  And I  will turn their captivity, <i>even</i> the captivity of Sodom and her daughters;  and I will turn the captivity of Samaria and her daughters; and I will turn thy  captivity in the midst of them:   
54 |   that thou mayest bear thy punishment, and be dishonoured for all that thou hast  done in provoking me to anger.    
55 |  And thy sister Sodom and her  daughters shall be restored as they were at the beginning, and thou and thy  daughters shall be restored as ye were at the beginning.    
56 |  And surely thy sister Sodom was not  mentioned by thy mouth in the days of thy pride:   
57 |   before thy wickedness was discovered, even now thou art the  reproach of the daughters of Syria, and of all that are round about her, <i>even</i>  of the daughters of the Philistines that compass thee round about.    
58 |  <i>As for</i> thine ungodliness and  thine iniquities, thou hast borne them, saith the Lord.    
59 |  Thus saith the Lord; I will even do  to thee as thou hast done, as thou hast dealt shamefully in these things to  transgress my covenant.   
60 |  And I  will remember my covenant <i>made</i> with thee in the days of thine infancy,  and I will establish to thee an everlasting covenant.   
61 |  Then thou shalt remember thy way, and shalt be utterly  dishonoured when thou receivest thine elder sisters with thy younger ones: and I  will give them to thee for building up, but not by thy covenant.    
62 |  And I will establish my covenant with  thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord:   
63 |   that thou mayest remember, and be ashamed, and mayest no more be  able to open thy mouth for thy shame, when I am reconciled to thee for all that  thou hast done, saith the Lord.   Chapter  17

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, relate a  tale, and speak a parable to the house of Israel:   
3 |   and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; A great eagle with large  wings, spreading them out very far, with many claws, which has the design of  entering into Libanus—and he took the choice <i>branches</i> of the cedar:   
4 |  he cropped off the ends of the  tender twigs, and brought them into the land of Chanaan; he laid them up in a  walled city.   
5 |  And he took of the  seed of the land, and sowed it in a field planted by much water; he set it in a  conspicuous place.   
6 |  And it sprang  up, and became a weak and little vine, so that the branches thereof appeared <i> upon</i> it, and its roots were under it: and it became a vine, and put forth  shoots, and sent forth its tendrils.    
7 |  And there was another great eagle,  with great wings and many claws: and, behold, this vine bent itself round toward  him, and her roots <i>were turned</i> towards him, and she sent forth her  branches towards him, that <i>he</i> might water her together with the growth of  her plantation.   
8 |  She thrives in a  fair field by much water, to produce shoots and bear fruit, that she might  become a great vine.    
9 |  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord;  Shall it prosper? shall not the roots of her tender stem and her fruit be  blighted? yea, all her early shoots shall be dried up, and <i>that</i> not by a  mighty arm, nor by many people, to tear her up from her roots.    
10 |  And, behold, it thrives: shall it  prosper? shall it not wither as soon as the east wind touches it? it shall be  withered together with the growth of its shoots.    
11 |  Moreover the word of the Lord came to  me saying,   
12 |  Son of man, say now to  the provoking house, Know ye not what these things were? say <i>to them</i>,  Whenever the king of Babylon shall come against Jerusalem, then he shall take  her king and her princes, and shall take them home to Babylon.    
13 |  And he shall take of the seed royal, and  shall make a covenant with him, and shall bind him with an oath: and he shall  take the princes of the land:   
14 |   that it may become a weak kingdom, so as never to lift itself up, that he may  keep his covenant, and establish it.   
15 |   And <i>if</i> he shall revolt from him, to send his messengers  into Egypt, that <i>they</i> may give him horses and much people; shall he  prosper? shall he that acts as an adversary be preserved? and shall he that  transgresses the covenant be preserved?    
16 |  <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord,  verily in <i>the</i> place where the king is that made him king, who dishonoured  my oath, and who broke my covenant, shall he die with him in the midst of  Babylon.   
17 |  And Pharaoh shall make  war upon him not with a large force or great multitude, in throwing up a mound,  and in building of forts, to cut off souls.   
18 |   Whereas he has profaned the oath so as to break the covenant,  when, behold, I engage his hand, and he has done all these things to him, he  shall not escape.    
19 |  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord; <i>As</i> I live, surely mine oath which he has profaned, and my covenant which  he has transgressed, I will even recompense it upon his head.    
20 |  And I will spread a net upon him, and he  shall be caught in its snare.   
21 |  In  every battle of his they shall fall by the sword, and I will scatter <i>his</i>  remnant to every wind: and ye shall know that I the Lord have spoken it.  
22 |  For thus saith the Lord; I will even  take of the choice <i>branches</i> of the cedar from the top <i>thereof</i>, I  will crop off their hearts, and I will plant it on a high mountain:    
23 |  and I will hang it on a lofty mountain  of Israel: yea, I will plant it, and it shall put forth shoots, and shall bear  fruit, and it shall be a great cedar: and every bird shall rest beneath it, even  every fowl shall rest under its shadow: its branches shall be restored.    
24 |  And all the trees of the field shall  know that I am the Lord that bring low the high tree, and exalt the low tree,  and wither the green tree, and cause the dry tree to flourish: I the Lord have  spoken, and will do <i>it</i>.   Chapter  18

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, what mean  ye by this parable among the children of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten  unripe grapes, and the children’s teeth have been set on edge?    
3 |  <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord,  surely this parable shall no more be spoken in Israel.   
4 |  For all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also  the soul of the son, they are mine: the soul that sins, it shall die.     
5 |  But the man who shall be just, who  executes judgment and righteousness,   
6 |   who shall not eat upon the mountains, and shall not at all lift  up his eyes to the devices of the house of Israel, and shall not defile his  neighbor’s wife, and shall not draw nigh to her that is removed,    
7 |  and shall not oppress any man, <i>but</i>  shall return the pledge of the debtor, and shall be guilty of no plunder, shall  give his bread to the hungry, and clothe the naked;   
8 |  and shall not lend his money upon usury, and shall not  receive usurious increase, and shall turn back his hand from injustice, shall  execute righteous judgment between a man and his neighbor,    
9 |  and has walked in my commandments and  kept mine ordinances, to do them; he is righteous, he shall surely live, saith  the Lord.  
10 |  And if he beget a mischievous son,  shedding blood and committing sins,   
11 |   who has not walked in the way of his righteous father, but has  even eaten upon the mountains, and has defiled his neighbor’s wife,    
12 |  and has oppressed the poor and needy,  and has committed robbery, and not restored a pledge, and has set his eyes upon  idols, has wrought iniquities,   
13 |   has lent upon usury, and taken usurious increase; he shall by no means live: he  has wrought all these iniquities; he shall surely die; his blood shall be upon  him.    
14 |  And if he beget a son, and <i>the son</i>  see all his father’s sins which he has wrought, and fear, and not do according  to them,   
15 |  and <i>if he</i> has not  eaten on the mountains, and has not set his eyes on the devices of the house of  Israel, and has not defiled his neighbor’s wife,   
16 |   and has not oppressed a man, and has not retained the pledge, nor  committed robbery, has given his bread to the hungry, and has clothed the naked,   
17 |  and has turned back his hand from  unrighteousness, has not received interest or usurious increase, has wrought  righteousness, and walked in mine ordinances; he shall not die for the  iniquities of his father, he shall surely live.   
18 |   But if his father grievously afflict, or plunder, he has wrought  enmity in the midst of my people, and shall die in his iniquity.    
19 |  But ye will say, Why has not the son  borne the iniquity of the father? Because the son has wrought judgment and  mercy, has kept all my statues, and done them, he shall surely live.    
20 |  But the soul that sins shall die: and  the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, nor shall the father bear the  iniquity of the son: the righteousness of the righteous shall be upon him, and  the iniquity of the transgressor shall be upon him.  
21 |  And if the transgressor turn away  from all his iniquities which he has committed, and keep all my commandments,  and do justice and mercy, he shall surely live, and shall by no means die.   
22 |  None of his trespasses which he  has committed shall be remembers: in his righteousness which he has done he  shall live.   
23 |  Shall I at all desire  death of the sinner, saith the Lord, as I <i>desire</i> that he should turn from <i>his</i> evil way, and live?    
24 |  But when the righteous man turns away  from his righteousness, and commits iniquity, according to all the  transgressions which the transgressor has wrought, none of his righteousness  which he has wrought shall be at all remembered: in his trespass wherein he has  trespassed, and in his sins wherein he has sinned, in them shall he die.     
25 |  Yet ye have said, The way of the Lord  is not straight. Hear now, all the house of Israel; will not my way be straight?  Is your way straight?   
26 |  When the  righteous turns away from his righteousness and commits a trespass, and dies in  the trespass he has committed, he shall <i>even</i> die in it.    
27 |  And when the wicked man turns away from  his wickedness that he has committed, and shall do judgment and justice, he has  kept his soul,   
28 |  and has turned  away from all his ungodliness which he has committed: he shall surely live, he  shall not die.    
29 |  Yet the house of Israel say, The way  of the Lord is not right. Is not my way right, O house of Israel? is not your  way wrong?   
30 |  I will judge you, O  house of Israel, saith the Lord, each one according to his way: be converted,  and turn from all your ungodliness, and it shall not become to you the  punishment of iniquity.   
31 |  Cast away  from yourselves all your ungodliness wherein ye have sinned against me; and make  to yourselves a new heart and a new spirit: for why should ye die, O house of  Israel?   
32 |  For I desire not the  death of him that dies, saith the Lord.   Chapter  19

1 |  Moreover do thou take up a  lamentation for the prince of Israel,   
2 |   and say, Why is thy mother become a whelp in the midst of lions?  in the midst of lions she has multiplied her whelps.   
3 |  And one of her whelps sprang forth; he became a lion, and  learned to take prey, he devoured men.   
4 |   And the nations heard a report of him; he was caught in their  pit, and they brought him into the land of Egypt in chains.    
5 |  And she saw that he was driven away  from her, <i>and</i> her hope <i>of him</i> perished, and she took another of  her whelps; she made him a lion.   
6 |   And he went up and down in the midst of lions, he became a lion, and learned to  take prey, he devoured men.   
7 |  And he  prowled in his boldness and laid waste their cities, and made the land desolate,  and the fullness of it, by the voice of his roaring.    
8 |  Then the nations set upon him from the  countries round about, and they spread their nets upon him: he was taken in  their pit.   
9 |  And they put him in  chains and in a cage, <i>and</i> he came to the king of Babylon; and he cast him  into prison, that his voice should not be heard on the mountains of Israel.   
10 |  Thy mother was as a vine and as a  blossom on a pomegranate tree, planted by water: her fruit and her shoot  abounded by reason of much water.   
11 |   And she became a rod for a tribe of princes, and was elevated in  her bulk in the midst of <i>other</i> trees, and she saw her bulk in the  multitude of her branches.    
12 |  But she was broken down in wrath, she  was cast upon the ground, and the east wind dried up her choice <i>branches</i>:  vengeance came upon them, and the rod of her strength was withered; fire  consumed it.   
13 |  And now they have  planted her in the wilderness, in a dry land.   
14 |   And fire is gone out of a rod of her choice <i>boughs</i>, and  has devoured her; and there was no rod of strength in her. Her race is become a  parable of lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation.   Chapter  20

1 |  And it came to pass in the seventh  year, on the fifteenth day of the month, there came men of the elders of the  house of Israel to enquire of the Lord, and they sat before me.    
2 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
3 |  Son of man, speak to the  elders of the house of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord;  Are ye come to enquire of me? <i>As</i> I live, I will not be enquired of by  you, saith the Lord.   
4 |  Shall I  utterly take vengeance on them, son of man? testify to them of the iniquities of  their fathers:  
 5 |  and thou shalt say  to them, Thus saith the Lord;    From the day that I chose the house of Israel, and became  known to the seed of the house of Jacob, and was known to them in the land of  Egypt, and helped them with my hand, saying, I am the Lord your God;    
6 |  in that day I helped them with my hand,  to bring them out of the land of Egypt into the land which I prepared for them,  a land flowing with milk and honey, it is abundant beyond every land.    
7 |  And I said to them, Let every one cast  away the abominations of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the devices of  Egypt: I am the Lord your God.    
8 |  But they revolted from me, and would  not hearken to me: they cast not away the abominations of their eyes, and  forsook not the devices of Egypt: then I said that I would pour out my wrath  upon them, to accomplish my wrath upon them in the midst of Egypt.    
9 |  But I wrought <i>so</i> that my name  should not be at all profaned in the sight of the Gentiles, in the midst of whom  they are, among whom I was made known to them in their sight, to bring them out  of the land of Egypt.  
10 |  And I brought them into the  wilderness.   
11 |  And I gave them my  commandments, and made known to them mine ordinances, all which <i>if</i> a man  shall do, he shall even live in them.   
12 |   And I gave them my sabbaths, that they should be for a sign  between me and them, that they should know that I am the Lord that sanctify  them.    
13 |  And I said to the house of Israel in  the wilderness, Walk ye in my commandments: but they walked not <i>in them</i>,  and they rejected mine ordinances, which <i>if</i> a man shall do, he shall even  live in them; and they grievously profaned my sabbaths: and I said that I would  pour out my wrath upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.    
14 |  But I wrought <i>so</i> that my name  should not be at all profaned before the Gentiles, before whose eyes I brought  them out.    
15 |  But I lifted up my hand against them  in the wilderness once for all, that I would not bring them into the land which  I gave them, a land flowing with milk and honey, it is sweeter than all lands:   
16 |  because they rejected mine  ordinances, and walked not in my commandments, but profaned my sabbaths, and  went after the imaginations of their hearts.    
17 |  Yet mine eyes spared them, so as <i> not</i> to destroy them utterly, and I did not make an end of them in the  wilderness.   
18 |  And I said to their  children in the wilderness, Walk not ye in the customs of your fathers, and keep  not their ordinances, and have no fellowship with their practices, nor defile  yourselves <i>with them</i>.   
19 |  I <i> am</i> the Lord your God; walk in my commandments, and keep mine ordinances, and  do them;   
20 |  and hallow my sabbaths,  and let them be a sign between me and you, that ye may know that I am the Lord  your God.    
21 |  But they provoked me, and their  children walked not in my commandments, and they took no heed to mine ordinances  to do them, which <i>if</i> a man shall do, he shall even live in them, and they  profaned my sabbaths: then I said that I would pour out my wrath upon them in  the wilderness, to accomplish mine anger upon them.   
22 |  But I wrought so that my name might not be at all profaned  before the Gentiles; and I brought them out in their sight.    
23 |  I lifted up my hand against them in  the wilderness, that I would scatter them among the Gentiles, <i>and</i>  disperse them in the countries;   
24 |   because they kept not mine ordinances, and rejected my commandments, and  profaned my sabbaths, and their eyes went after the imaginations of their  fathers.    
25 |  So I gave them commandments <i>that  were</i> not good, and ordinances in which they should not live.    
26 |  And I will defile them by their <i>own</i>  decrees, when I pass through upon every one that opens the womb, that I may  destroy them.  
27 |  Therefore, son of man, speak to the  house of Israel, and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord: Hitherto have  your fathers provoked me in their trespasses in which they transgressed against  me.   
28 |  Whereas I brought them into  the land concerning which I lifted up mine hand to give it them; and they looked  upon every high hill, and every shady tree, and they sacrificed there to their  gods, and offered there sweet-smelling savour, and there they poured out their  drink-offerings.   
29 |  And I said to  them, What is Abama, that ye go in thither? and they called its name Abama,  until this day.    
30 |  Therefore say to the house of Israel,  Thus saith the Lord, Do ye pollute yourselves with the iniquities of your  fathers, and do ye go a-whoring after their abominations,   
 31 |  and <i>do ye pollute yourselves</i> with the  first-fruits of your gifts, in the offerings wherewith ye pollute yourselves in  all your imaginations, until this day; and shall I answer you, O house of  Israel? <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord, I will not answer you, neither shall  this thing come upon your spirit.   
32 |   And it shall not be as ye say, We will be as the nations, and as  the tribes of the earth, to worship stocks and stones.  
33 |  Therefore, <i>as</i> I live, saith  the Lord, I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and  with outpoured wrath:   
34 |  I will  bring you out from the nations, and will take you out of the lands wherein ye  were dispersed, with a strong hand, and with a high arm, and with outpoured  wrath.   
35 |  And I will bring you into  the wilderness of the nations, and will plead with you there face to face.    
36 |  As I pleaded with your fathers in the  wilderness of the land of Egypt, so will I judge you, saith the Lord.    
37 |  And I will cause you to pass under my  rod, and I will bring you in by number.   
38 |   And I will separate from among you the ungodly and the revolters;  for I will lead them forth out of their place of sojourning, and they shall not  enter into the land of Israel: and ye shall know that I am the Lord, <i>even</i>  the Lord.    
39 |  And <i>as to</i> you, O house of  Israel, thus saith the Lord, <i>even</i> the Lord; Put away each one his <i>evil</i>  practices, and hereafter if ye hearken to me, then shall ye no more profane my  holy name by your gifts and by devices.   
40 |   For upon my holy mountain, on the high mountain, saith the Lord, <i>even</i> the Lord, there shall all the house of Israel serve me for ever: and  there will I accept <i>you</i>, and there will I have respect to your  first-fruits, and the first-fruits of your offerings, in all your holy things.    
41 |  I will accept you with a  sweet-smelling savour, when I bring you out from the nations, and take you out  of the countries wherein ye have been dispersed; and I will be sanctified among  you in the sight of the nations.   
42 |   And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have brought you into the land of  Israel, into the land concerning which I lifted up my hand to give it to your  fathers.   
43 |  And ye shall there  remember your ways, and your devices wherewith ye defiled yourselves; and ye  shall bewail yourselves for all your wickedness.   
44 |   And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have done thus to  you, that my name may not be profaned in your evil ways, and in your corrupt  devices, saith the Lord.  
45 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
46 |  Son of man, set thy face  against Thaeman, and look toward Darom, and prophesy against the chief forest of  Nageb,   
47 |  and thou shalt say to the  forest of Nageb, Hear the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord, <i>even</i> the  Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> kindle a fire in thee, and it shall devour in thee  every green tree, and every dry tree: the flame that is kindled shall not be  quenched, and every face shall be scorched with it from the south to the north.   
48 |  And all flesh shall know that I  the Lord have kindled it: it shall not be quenched.    
49 |  And I said, Not so, O Lord God! they  say to me, Is not this that is spoken a parable?   Chapter  21   

#21
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,    
2 |  Therefore prophesy, son of man, set  thy face steadfastly toward Jerusalem, and look toward their holy places, and  thou shalt prophesy against the land of Israel,   
3 |   and thou shalt say to the land of Israel, Thus saith the Lord;  Behold, I am against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and  I will destroy out of thee the transgressor and unrighteous.    
4 |  Because I will destroy out of thee the  unrighteous and the transgressor, <i>therefore</i> so shall my sword come forth  out of its sheath against all flesh from the south to the north:    
5 |  and all flesh shall know that I the Lord  have drawn forth my sword out of its sheath: it shall not return any more.    
6 |  And thou, son of man, groan with the  breaking of thy loins; thou shalt even groan heavily in their sight.    
7 |  And it shall come to pass, if they shall  say to thee, Wherefore dost thou groan? that thou shalt say, For the report;  because it comes: and every heart shall break, and all hands shall become  feeble, and all flesh and every spirit shall faint, and all thighs shall be  defiled with moisture: behold, it comes, saith the Lord.  
8 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
9 |  Son of man, prophesy, and  thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; Say, Sword, sword, be sharpened and rage,   
10 |  that thou mayest slay victims; be  sharpened that thou mayest be bright, ready for slaughter, slay, set at nought,  despise every tree.   
11 |  And he made  it ready for his hand to hold: the sword is sharpened, it is ready to put into  the hand of the slayer.    
12 |  Cry out and howl, son of man: for  this <i>sword</i> is come upon my people, this <i>sword is come</i> upon all the  princes of Israel: they shall be as strangers: <i>judgment</i> with the sword is  come upon my people: therefore clap thine hands, for sentence has been passed:   
13 |  and what if even the tribe be  rejected? it shall not be, saith the Lord God.    
14 |  And thou, son of man, prophesy, and  clap thine hands, and take a second sword: the third sword is <i>the sword</i>  of the slain, the great sword of the slain: and thou shalt strike them with  amazement, lest the heart should faint   
15 |   and the weak ones be multiplied at every gate—they are given up  to the slaughter of the sword: it is well fitted for slaughter, it is well  fitted for glittering.   
16 |  And do  thou go on, sharpen thyself on the right and on the left whithersoever thy face  may set itself.    
17 |  And I also will clap my hands, and  let loose my fury: I the Lord have spoken <i>it</i>.  
18 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
19 |  and thou, son of man,  appoint thee two ways, that the sword of the king of Babylon may enter in: the  two shall go forth of one country; and <i>there shall be</i> a force at the top  of the way of the city, thou shalt set <i>it</i> at the top of the way,    
20 |  that the sword may enter in upon Rabbath  of the children of Ammon, and upon Judea, and upon Jerusalem in the midst  thereof.    
21 |  For the king of Babylon shall stand  on the old way, at the head of the two ways, to use divination, to make bright  the arrow, and to enquire of the graven images, and to examine <i>the victims</i>.   
22 |  On his right was the divination  against Jerusalem, to cast a mound, to open the mouth in shouting, to lift up  the voice with crying, to cast a mound against her gates, to cast up a heap, and  to build forts.   
23 |  And he was to  them as one using divination before them, and he himself recounting his  iniquities, that they might be borne in mind.    
24 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord,  Because ye have caused your iniquities to be remembered, in the discovery of  your wickedness, so that your sins should be seen, in all your wickedness and in  your <i>evil</i> practices; because ye have caused remembrance <i>of them</i>,  in these shall ye be taken.   
25 |  And  thou profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day, <i>even</i> an end, is come in  a sea of iniquity, thus saith the Lord;   
26 |   Thou hast taken off the mitre and put on the crown, it shall not  have such <i>another</i> after it: thou hast abased that which was high, and  exalted that which was low.   
27 |   Injustice, injustice, injustice, will I make it: woe to it: such shall it be  until he comes to whom it belongs; and I will deliver <i>it</i> to him.  
28 |  And thou, son of man, prophesy, and  thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, concerning the children of Ammon, and  concerning their reproach; and thou shalt say, O sword, sword, drawn for  slaughter, and drawn for destruction, awake, that thou mayest gleam.    
29 |  While thou art seeing vain <i>visions</i>,  and while thou art prophesying falsehoods, to bring thyself upon the necks of  ungodly transgressors, the day is come, <i>even</i> an end, in a season of  iniquity.    
30 |  Turn, rest not in this place wherein  thou wert born: in thine own land will I judge thee.   
31 |  And I will pour out my wrath upon thee, I will blow upon  thee with the fire of my wrath, and I will deliver thee into the hands of  barbarians skilled in working destruction.   
32 |   Thou shalt be fuel for fire; thy blood shall be in the midst of  thy land; there shall be no remembrance at all of thee: for I the Lord have  spoken <i>it</i>.   Chapter  22

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  And thou, son of man,  wilt thou judge the bloody city? yea, declare thou to her all her iniquities.   
3 |  And thou shalt say, Thus saith the  Lord God: O city that sheds blood in the midst of her, so that her time should  come, and that forms devices against herself, to defile herself;    
4 |  in their blood which thou hast shed, thou  hast transgressed; and in thy devices which thou hast formed, thou hast polluted  thyself; and thou hast brought nigh thy days, and hast brought on the time of  thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach to the Gentiles, and a mockery  to all the countries,   
5 |  to those  near thee, and to those far distant from thee; and they shall mock thee, <i>thou  that art</i> notoriously unclean, and abundant in iniquities.    
6 |  Behold, the princes of the house of  Israel have conspired in thee each one with his kindred, that they might shed  blood.   
7 |  In thee they have reviled  father and mother; and in thee they have behaved unjustly toward the stranger:  they have oppressed the orphan and widow.   
8 |   And they have set at nought my holy things, and in thee they have  profaned my sabbaths.   
9 |  <i>There are</i>  robbers in thee, to shed blood in thee; and in thee they have eaten upon the  mountains: they have wrought ungodliness in the midst of thee.    
10 |  In thee they have uncovered the father’s  shame; and in thee they have humbled her that was set apart for uncleanness.   
11 |  They have dealt unlawfully each  one with his neighbor’s wife; and each one in ungodliness has defiled his  daughter-in-law: and in thee they have humbled each one his sister, the daughter  of his father.    
12 |  In thee they have received gifts to  shed blood; they have received in thee interest and usurious increase; and by  oppression thou hast brought thy wickedness to the full, and hast forgotten me,  saith the Lord.    
13 |  And if I shall smite my hand at <i> thine iniquities</i> which thou hast accomplished, which thou hast wrought, and  at thy blood that has been shed in the midst of thee,   
14 |  shall thy heart endure? shall thine hands be strong in the  days which I bring upon thee? I the Lord have spoken, and will do <i>it</i>.   
15 |  And I will scatter thee among the  nations, and disperse thee in the countries, and thy uncleanness shall be  removed out of thee.   
16 |  And I will  give heritages in thee in the sight of the nations, and ye shall know that I am  the Lord.  
17 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
18 |  Son of man, behold, the  house of Israel are all become to me <i>as it were</i> mixed with brass, and  iron, and tin, and lead; they are mixed up in the midst of the silver.     
19 |  Therefore say, Thus saith the Lord  God; Because ye have become one mixture, therefore I will gather you into the  midst of Jerusalem.   
20 |  As silver,  and brass, and iron, and tin, and lead, are gathered into the midst of the  furnace, to blow fire into it, that they may be melted: so will I take <i>you</i>  in my wrath, and I will gather and melt you.   
21 |   And I will blow upon you in the fire of my wrath, and ye shall be  melted in the midst thereof.   
22 |  As  silver is melted in the midst of a furnace, so shall ye be melted in the midst  thereof; and ye shall know that I the Lord have poured out my wrath upon you.  
23 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
24 |  Son of man, say to her,  Thou art the land that is not rained upon, neither has rain come upon thee in  the day of wrath;   
25 |  whose princes  in the midst of her are as roaring lions seizing prey, devouring souls by  oppression, and taking bribes; and thy widows are multiplied in the midst of  thee.   
26 |  Her priests also have set  at nought my law, and profaned my holy things: they have not distinguished  between the holy and profane, nor have they distinguished between the unclean  and the clean, and have hid their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was profaned in  the midst of them.   
27 |  Her princes in  the midst of her are as wolves ravening to shed blood, that they may get  dishonest gain.   
28 |  And her prophets  that daub them shall fall, that see vanities, that prophesy falsehoods, saying,  Thus saith the Lord, when the Lord has not spoken.   
29 |  That sorely oppress the people of the land with injustice,  and commit robbery; oppressing the poor and needy, and not dealing justly with  the stranger.    
30 |  And I sought from among them a man  behaving uprightly, and standing before me perfectly in the time of wrath, so  that I should not utterly destroy her: but I found <i>him</i> not.    
31 |  So I have poured out my wrath upon her  in the fury of mine anger, to accomplish <i>it</i>. I have recompensed their  ways on their own heads, saith the Lord God.   Chapter  23     

#23
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, there were  two women, daughters of one mother:   
3 |   and they went a-whoring in Egypt in their youth: there their  breasts fell, there they lost their virginity.   
4 |   And their names were Oola the elder, and Ooliba her sister: and  they were mine, and bore sons and daughters: and <i>as for</i> their names,  Samaria was Oola, and Jerusalem was Ooliba.    
5 |  And Oola went a-whoring from me, and  doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians that were her neighbors,    
6 |  clothed with purple, princes and  captains; <i>they were</i> young men and choice, all horseman riding on horses.   
7 |  And she bestowed her fornication  upon them; all were choice sons of the Assyrians: and on whomsoever she doted  herself, with them she defiled herself in all <i>their</i> devices.    
8 |  And she forsook not her fornication with  the Egyptians: for in her youth they committed fornication with her, and they  deflowered her, and poured out their fornication upon her.    
9 |  Therefore I delivered her into the hands  of her lovers, into the hands of the children of the Assyrians, on whom she  doted.   
10 |  They uncovered her shame:  they took her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword: and she became a  byword among women: and they wrought vengeance in her for the sake of the  daughters.  
11 |  And her sister Ooliba saw <i>it</i>,  and she indulged in her fondness more corruptly than she, and in her fornication  more than the fornication of her sister.   
12 |   She doted upon the sons of the Assyrian, princes and captains,  her neighbours, clothed with fine linen, horsemen riding on horses; <i>they were</i>  all choice young men.   
13 |  And I saw  that they were defiled, <i>that</i> the two <i>had</i> one way.    
14 |  And she increased her fornication,  and she saw men painted on the wall, likenesses of the Chaldeans painted with a  pencil,   
15 |  having variegated girdles  on their loins, having also richly dyed <i>attire</i> upon their heads; all had  a princely appearance, the likeness of the children of the Chaldeans, of their  native land.   
16 |  And she doted upon  them as soon as she saw them, and sent forth messengers to them into the land of  the Chaldeans.   
17 |  And the sons of  Babylon came to her, into the bed of rest, and they defiled her in her  fornication, and she was defiled by them, and her soul was alienated from them.   
18 |  And she exposed her fornication,  and exposed her shame: and my soul was alienated from her, even as my soul was  alienated from her sister.    
19 |  And thou didst multiply thy  fornication, so as to call to remembrance the days of thy youth, wherein thou  didst commit whoredom in Egypt,   
20 |   and thou didst dote upon the Chaldeans, whose flesh is as the flesh of the  asses, and their members <i>as</i> the members of horses.   
 21 |  And thou didst look upon the iniquity of thy youth, <i> the things</i> which thou wroughtest in Egypt in thy lodgings, where were the  breasts of thy youth.  
22 |  Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the  Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> stir up thy lovers against thee, from whom thy soul  is alienated, and I will bring them upon thee round about,    
23 |  the children of Babylon, and all the  Chaldeans, Phacuc, and Sue, and Hychue, and all the sons of the Assyrians with  them; choice young men, governors and captains, all princes and renowned, riding  on horses.   
24 |  And they all shall  come upon thee from the north, chariots and wheels, with a multitude of nations,  shields and targets; and <i>the enemy</i> shall set a watch against thee round  about: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall take vengeance on  thee with their judgments.   
25 |  And I  will bring upon thee my jealousy, and they shall deal with thee in great wrath:  they shall take away thy nose and thine ears; and shall cast down thy remnant  with the sword: they shall take thy sons and thy daughters; and thy remnant fire  shall devour.   
26 |  And they shall  strip thee of thy raiment, and take <i>away</i> thine ornaments.    
27 |  So I will turn back thine ungodliness  from thee, and thy fornication from the land of Egypt: and thou shalt not lift  up thine eyes upon them, and shalt no more remember Egypt.    
28 |  Wherefore thus saith the Lord God;  Behold, I <i>will</i> deliver thee into the hands of those whom thou hatest,  from whom thy soul is alienated.   
29 |   And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and shall take all <i>the fruits</i> of  thy labours and thy toils, and thou shalt be naked and bare: and the shame of  thy fornication shall be exposed: and thy ungodliness and thy fornication    
30 |  brought this upon thee, in that thou  wentest a-whoring after the nations, and didst defile thyself with their  devices.    
31 |  Thou didst walk in the way of thy  sister; and I will put her cup into thine hands.   
32 |   Thus saith the Lord; Drink thy sister’s cup, deep and large, and  full, to cause complete drunkenness.   
33 |   And thou shalt be thoroughly weakened; and the cup of  destruction, the cup of thy sister Samaria,   
34 |   drink thou it, and I will take away her feasts and her new moons:  for I have spoken <i>it</i>, saith the Lord.   
35 |   Therefore thus saith the Lord; Because thou has forgotten me, and  cast me behind thy back, therefore receive thou <i>the reward</i> of thine  ungodliness and thy fornication.  
36 |  And the Lord said to me, Son of man,  wilt thou not judge Oola and Ooliba? and declare to them their iniquities?   
37 |  For they have committed adultery,  and blood was in their hands, they committed adultery with their devices, and  they passed through the fire to them their children which they bore to me.   
38 |  So long too as they did these  things to me, they defiled my sanctuary, and profaned my sabbaths.    
39 |  And when they sacrificed their children  to their idols, they also went into my sanctuary to profane it: and whereas they  did thus in the midst of my house;   
40 |   and whereas they did thus to the men that came from afar, to whom  they sent messengers, and as soon as they came, immediately thou didst wash  thyself, and didst paint thine eyes and adorn thyself with ornaments,    
41 |  and satest on a prepared bed, and before  it <i>there was</i> a table set out, and <i>as for</i> mine incense and mine  oil, they rejoiced in them,   
42 |  and  they raised a sound of music, and <i>that</i> with men coming from the  wilderness out of a multitude of men, and they put bracelets on their hands, and  a crown of glory on their heads;    
43 |  Therefore I said, Do they not commit  adultery with these? and has she also gone a-whoring <i>after</i> the manner of  a harlot?   
44 |  And they went in to  her, as <i>men</i> go in to a harlot; so they went in to Oola and to Ooliba to  work iniquity.   
45 |  And they are just  men, and shall take vengeance on them with the judgment of an adulteress and the  judgment of blood: for they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands.    
46 |  Thus saith the Lord God, Bring up a  multitude upon them, and send trouble and plunder into the midst of them.    
47 |  And stone them with the stones of a  multitude, and pierce them with their swords: they shall slay their sons and  their daughters, and shall burn up their houses.   
48 |   And I will remove ungodliness out of the land, and all the women  shall be instructed, and shall not do according to their ungodliness.    
49 |  And your ungodliness shall be  recompensed upon you, and ye shall bear the guilt of your devices: and ye shall  know that I am the Lord.   Chapter  24     

#24
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, in the ninth year, in the tenth month, on the tenth <i>day</i> of the month,  saying,   
2 |  Son of man, write for  thyself daily from this day, on which the king of Babylon set himself against  Jerusalem, <i>even</i> from this day.   
3 |   And speak a parable to the provoking house, and thou shalt say to  them,    Thus saith the Lord; Set on the caldron, and pour water into  it:   
4 |  and put the pieces into it,  every prime piece, the leg and shoulder taken off from the bones,    
5 |  <i>which are</i> taken from choice  cattle, and burn the bones under them: her bones are boiled and cooked in the  midst of her.    
6 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord; O  bloody city, the caldron in which there is scum, and the scum has not gone out  of, she has brought it forth piece by piece, no lot has fallen upon it.    
7 |  For her blood is in the midst of her; I  have set it upon a smooth rock: I have not poured it out upon the earth, so that  the earth should cover it;   
8 |  that my  wrath should come up for complete vengeance to be taken: I set her blood upon a  smooth rock, so as not to cover it.    
9 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord, I will  also make the firebrand great,   
10 |   and I will multiply the wood, and kindle the fire, that the flesh may be  consumed, and the liquor boiled away;   
11 |   and that <i>it</i> may stand upon the coals, that her brass may  be thoroughly heated, and be melted in the midst of her filthiness, and her scum  may be consumed,   
12 |  and her abundant  scum may not come forth of her.   
13 |   Her scum shall become shameful, because thou didst defile thyself: and what if  thou shalt be purged no more until I have accomplished my wrath?    
14 |  I the Lord have spoken; and it shall  come, and I will do <i>it</i>; I will not delay, neither will I have any mercy:  I will judge thee, saith the Lord, according to thy ways, and according to thy  devices: therefore will I judge thee according to thy bloodshed, and according  to thy devices will I judge thee, thou unclean, notorious, and abundantly  provoking one.  
15 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
16 |  Son of man, behold I take  from thee the desire of thine eyes by violence: thou shalt not lament, neither  shalt thou weep.   
17 |  Thou shalt groan  for blood, and have mourning upon thy loins; thy hair shall not be braided upon  thee, and thy sandals <i>shall be</i> on thy feet; thou shalt in no wise be  comforted by their lips, and thou shalt not eat the bread of men.    
18 |  And I spoke to the people in the  morning, as he commanded me in the evening, and I did in the morning as it was  commanded me.   
19 |  And the people said  to me, Wilt thou not tell us what these things are that thou doest?    
20 |  Then I said to them, The word of the  Lord came to me, saying,   
21 |  Say to  the house of Israel,    Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> profane my  sanctuary, the boast of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and for which  your souls are concerned; and your sons and your daughters, whom ye have left,  shall fall by the sword.   
22 |  And ye  shall do as I have done: ye shall not be comforted at their mouth, and ye shall  not eat the bread of men.   
23 |  And  your hair <i>shall be</i> upon your head, and your shoes on your feet: neither  shall ye at all lament or weep; but ye shall pine away in your iniquities, and  shall comfort every one his brother.   
24 |   And Jezekiel shall be for a sign to you: according to all that I  have done shall ye do, when these things shall come; and ye shall know that I am  the Lord.    
25 |  And thou, son of man, <i>shall it</i>  not <i>be</i> in the day when I take their strength from them, the pride of  their boasting, the desires of their eyes, and the pride of their soul, their  sons and their daughters,   
26 |  that in  that day he that escapes shall come to thee, to tell <i>it</i> thee in thine  ears?   
27 |  In that day thy mouth shall  be opened to him that escapes; thou shalt speak, and shalt be no longer dumb:  and thou shalt be for a sign to them, and they shall know that I am the Lord.   Chapter  25

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, set thy  face steadfastly against the children of Ammon, and prophesy against them;   
3 |  and thou shalt say to the children  of Ammon,    Hear ye the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord; Forasmuch  as ye have rejoiced against my sanctuary, because it was profaned; and against  the land of Israel, because it was laid waste; and against the house of Juda,  because they went into captivity;   
4 |   therefore, behold, I <i>will</i> deliver you to the children of Kedem for an  inheritance, and they shall lodge in thee with their stuff, and they shall pitch  their tents in thee: they shall eat thy fruits, and they shall drink thy milk.   
5 |  And I will give up the city of  Ammon for camels’ pastures, and the children of Ammon for a pasture of sheep:  and ye shall know that I am the Lord.    
6 |  For thus saith the Lord; Because thou  hast clapped thine hands, and stamped with thy foot, and heartily rejoiced  against the land of Israel;   
7 |   therefore I will stretch out my hand against thee, and I will make thee a spoil  to the nations; and I will utterly destroy thee from among the peoples, and I  will completely cut thee off from out of the countries: and thou shalt know that  I am the Lord.  
8 |  Thus saith the Lord; Because Moab has  said, Behold, are not the house of Israel and Juda like all the <i>other</i>  nations?   
9 |  Therefore, behold, I will  weaken the shoulder of Moab from his frontier cities, <i>even</i> the choice  land, the house of Bethasimuth above the fountain of the city, by the sea-side.   
10 |  I have given him the children of  Kedem in addition to the children of Ammon for an inheritance, that there may be  no remembrance of the children of Ammon.   
11 |   And I will execute vengeance on Moab; and they shall know that I  am the Lord.    
12 |  Thus saith the Lord; Because of what  the Idumeans have done in taking vengeance on the house of Juda, and <i>because  they</i> have remembered injuries, and have exacted full recompense;    
13 |  therefore thus saith the Lord; I will  also stretch out my hand upon Idumea, and will utterly destroy out of it man and  beast; and will make it desolate; and they that are pursued out of Thaeman shall  fall by the sword.   
14 |  And I will  execute my vengeance on Idumea by the hand of my people Israel: and they shall  deal in Idumea according to mine anger and according to my wrath, and they shall  know my vengeance, saith the Lord.    
15 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord,  Because the Philistines have wrought revengefully, and raised up vengeance  rejoicing from their heart to destroy <i>the Israelites</i> to a man;    
16 |  therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> stretch out my hand upon the Philistines, and will utterly destroy  the Cretans, and will cut off the remnant that dwell by the sea-coast.    
17 |  And I will execute great vengeance upon  them; and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I have brought my vengeance  upon them.   Chapter  26

1 |  And it came to pass in the eleventh  year, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the word of the Lord  came to me, saying,    
2 |  Son of man, because Sor has said  against Jerusalem, Aha, she is crushed: the nations are destroyed: she is turned  to me: she that was full is made desolate:   
3 |   therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, O Sor,  and I will bring up many nations against thee, as the sea comes up with its  waves.   
4 |  And they shall cast down  the walls of Sor, and shall cast down thy towers: and I will scrape her dust  from off her, and make her a bare rock.   
5 |   She shall be in the midst of the sea a place for repairing nets:  for I have spoken <i>it</i>, saith the Lord: and it shall be a spoil for the  nations.   
6 |  And her daughters <i> which are</i> in the field shall be slain with the sword, and they shall know  that I am the Lord.    
7 |  For thus saith the Lord; Behold, I <i> will</i> bring up against thee, O Sor, Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon from the  north: he is a king of kings, with horses, and chariots, and horsemen, and a  concourse of very many nations.   
8 |  He  shall slay thy daughters that are in the field with the sword, and shall set a  watch against thee, and build forts around thee, and carry a rampart round  against thee, and set up warlike works, and array his spears against thee.   
9 |  He shall cast down with his swords  thy walls and thy towers.   
10 |  By  reason of thy multitude of his horses their dust shall cover thee, and by reason  of the sound of his horsemen and the wheels of his chariots the walls shall be  shaken, when he enters into thy gates, as one entering into a city from the  plain.   
11 |  With the hoofs of his  horses they shall trample all thy streets: he shall slay thy people with the  sword, and shall bring down to the ground the support of thy strength.     
12 |  And he shall prey upon thy power, and  plunder thy substance, and shall cast down thy walls, and break down thy  pleasant houses: and he shall cast thy stones and thy timber and thy dust into  the midst of thy sea.   
13 |  And he  shall destroy the multitude of thy musicians, and the sound of thy psalteries  shall be heard no more.   
14 |  And I  will make thee a bare rock: thou shalt be a place to spread nets upon; thou  shalt be built no more: for I the Lord have spoken <i>it</i>, saith the Lord.  
15 |  For thus saith the Lord God to Sor;  Shall not the isles shake at the sound of thy fall, while the wounded are  groaning, while they have drawn a sword in the midst of thee?    
16 |  And all the princes of the nations of  the sea shall come down from their thrones, and shall take off their crowns from  their heads, and shall take off their embroidered raiment: they shall be utterly  amazed; they shall sit upon the ground, and fear their <i>own</i> destruction,  and shall groan over thee.   
17 |  And  they shall take up a lamentation for thee, and shall say to thee, How art thou  destroyed from out of the sea, the renowned city, that brought her terror upon  all her inhabitants.   
18 |  And the  isles shall be alarmed at the day of thy fall.    
19 |  For thus saith the Lord God; When I  shall make the city desolate, as the cities that shall not be inhabited, when I  have brought the deep up upon thee,   
20 |   and great waters shall cover thee; and I shall bring thee down to  them that go down to the pit, to the people of old time, and shall cause thee to  dwell in the depths of the earth, as in everlasting desolation, with them that  go down to the pit, that thou mayest not be inhabited, nor stand upon the land  of life;   
21 |  I will make thee a  destruction, and thou shalt be no more for ever, saith the Lord God.   Chapter  27   

#27
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to me  saying,    
2 |  And thou, son of man, take up a  lamentation against Sor;   
3 |  and thou  shalt say to Sor that dwells at the entrance of the sea, to the mart of the  nations coming from many islands, Thus saith the Lord to Sor;    Thou hast said, I have clothed myself with my beauty.    
4 |  In the heart of the sea thy sons have put  beauty upon thee for Beelim.   
5 |  Cedar  in Senir was employed for thee in building: boards of cypress timber were taken  out of Libanus, and wood to make thee masts of fir.   
6 |  They made thine oars <i>of wood</i> out of the land of  Basan; thy sacred utensils they made of ivory, thy shady houses of wood from the  isles of Chetiim.   
7 |  Fine linen with  embroidery from Egypt supplied the couch, to put honour upon thee, and to clothe  thee with blue and purple from the isles of Elisai; and they became thy  coverings.    
8 |  And thy princes were the dwellers in  Sidon, and the Aradians were thy rowers: thy wise men, O Sor, who were in thee,  these were thy pilots.   
9 |  The elders  of the Biblians, and their wise men, who were in thee, these helped thy counsel:  and all the ships of the sea and their rowers traded for thee to the utmost  west.    
10 |  Persians and Lydians and Libyans were  in thine army: thy warriors hung in thee shields and helmets; these gave <i>thee</i>  thy glory.   
11 |  The sons of the  Aradians and thine army were upon the walls; there were guards in thy towers:  they hung their quivers on thy battlements round about; these completed thy  beauty.    
12 |  The Carthaginians were thy merchants  because of the abundance of all thy strength; they furnished thy market with  silver, and gold, and iron, and tin, and lead.   
13 |   Greece, both the whole <i>world</i>, and the adjacent coasts,  these traded with thee in the persons of men, and they gave <i>as</i> thy  merchandise vessels of brass.    
14 |  Out of the house of Thogarma horses  and horsemen furnished the market.   
15 |   The sons of the Rhodians were thy merchants; from the islands  they multiplied thy merchandise, <i>even</i> elephants’ teeth: and to them that  came in thou didst return thy prices,   
16 |   <i>even</i> men <i>as</i> thy merchandise, from the multitude of  thy trading <i>population</i>, myrrh and embroidered works from Tharsis: Ramoth  also and Chorchor furnished thy market.   
17 |   Juda and the children of Israel, these were thy merchants; in the  sale of corn and ointments and cassia: and they gave the best honey, and oil,  and resin, to thy trading <i>population</i>.   
18 |   <i>The people of</i> Damascus were thy merchants by reason of the  abundance of all thy power; wine out of Chelbon, and wool from Miletus; and they  brought wine into thy market.    
19 |  Out of Asel <i>came</i> wrought iron,  and there is the sound of wheels among thy trading <i>population</i>.    
20 |  <i>The people of</i> Daedan were thy  merchants, with choice cattle for chariots.   
21 |   Arabia and all the princes of Kedar, these were thy traders with  thee, <i>bringing</i> camels, and lambs, and rams, in which they trade with  thee.   
22 |  The merchants of Sabba and  Ramma, these were thy merchants, with choice spices, and precious stones: and  they brought gold to thy market.   
23 |   Charra, and Chanaa, these were thy merchants: Assur, and Charman, were thy  merchants:   
24 |  bringing <i>for</i>  merchandise blue, and choice stores bound with cords, and cypress wood.    
25 |  Ships were thy merchants, in abundance,  with thy trading <i>population</i>: and thou wast filled and very heavily loaded  in the heart of the sea.  
26 |  Thy rowers have brought thee into  great waters: the south wind has broken thee in the heart of the sea.    
27 |  Thy forces, and thy gain, and that of  thy traders, and thy rowers, and thy pilots, and thy counselors, and they that  traffic with thee, and all thy warriors that are in thee: and all thy company in  the midst of thee shall perish in the heart of the sea, in the day of thy fall.   
28 |  At the cry of thy voice thy  pilots shall be greatly terrified.    
29 |  And all the rowers and the mariners  shall come down from the ships, and the pilots of the sea shall stand on the  land.   
30 |  And they shall wail over  thee with their voice, and cry bitterly, and put earth on their heads, and  spread ashes under them.    
31 32 |  And their sons shall take up a <i> lament</i> for thee, even a lamentation for Sor, <i>saying</i>,    
33 |  How large a reward hast thou gained from  the sea? thou hast filled nations out of thine abundance; and out of thy mixed  merchandise thou hast enriched all the kings of the earth.    
34 |  Now art thou broken in the sea, thy  traders are in the deep water, and all thy company in the midst of thee: all thy  rowers have fallen.   
35 |  All the  dwellers in the islands have mourned over thee, and their kings have been  utterly amazed, and their countenance has wept.   
36 |   Merchants from the nations have hissed at thee; thou art utterly  destroyed, and shalt not be any more for ever.   Chapter  28

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,    
2 |  And thou, son of man, say to the  prince of Tyrus, Thus saith the Lord; Because thine heart has been exalted, and  thou hast said, I am God, I have inhabited the dwelling of God in the heart of  the sea; yet thou art man and not God, though thou hast set thine heart as the  heart of God:   
3 |  art thou wiser than  Daniel? or have not the wise instructed thee with their knowledge?    
4 |  Hast thou gained power for thyself by  thine <i>own</i> knowledge or thine <i>own</i> prudence, and <i>gotten</i> gold  and silver in thy treasures?   
5 |  By  thy abundant knowledge and thy traffic thou hast multiplied thy power; thy heart  has been lifted up by thy power.    
6 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Since  thou hast set thine heart as the hart of God;   
7 |   because of this, behold, I <i>will</i> bring on thee strange  plagues from the nations; and they shall draw their swords against thee, and  against the beauty of thy knowledge,   
8 |   and they shall bring down thy beauty to destruction. And they  shall bring thee down; and thou shalt die the death of the slain in the heart of  the sea.   
9 |  Wilt thou indeed say, I  am God, before them that slay thee? whereas thou art man, and not God.    
10 |  Thou shalt perish by the hands of  strangers among the multitude of the uncircumcised: for I have spoken it, saith  the Lord.  
11 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
12 |  Son of man, take up a  lamentation for the prince of Tyre, and say to him, Thus saith the Lord God;  Thou art a seal of resemblance, and crown of beauty.   
13 |  Thou wast in the delight of the paradise of God; thou hast  bound upon thee every precious stone, the sardius, and topaz, and emerald, and  carbuncle, and sapphire, and jasper, and silver, and gold, and ligure, and  agate, and amethyst, and chrysolite, and beryl, and onyx: and thou hast filled  thy treasures and thy stores in thee with gold.   
14 |   From the day that thou wast created thou <i>wast</i> with the  cherub: I set thee on the holy mount of God; thou wast in the midst of the  stones of fire.   
15 |  Thou wast  faultless in thy days, from the day that thou wast created, until iniquity was  found in thee.    
16 |  Of the abundance of thy merchandise  thou hast filled thy storehouses with iniquity, and hast sinned: therefore thou  hast been cast down wounded from the mount of God, and the cherub has brought  thee out of the midst of the stones of fire.   
17 |   Thy heart has been lifted up because of thy beauty; thy knowledge  has been corrupted with thy beauty: because of the multitude of thy sins I have  cast thee to the ground, I have caused thee to be put to open shame before  kings.   
18 |  Because of the multitude  of thy sins and the iniquities of thy merchandise, I have profaned thy sacred  things; and I will bring fire out of the midst of thee, this shall devour thee;  and I will make thee <i>to be</i> ashes upon thy land before all that see thee.   
19 |  And all that know thee among the  nations shall groan over thee: thou art gone to destruction, and thou shalt not  exist any more.  
20 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
21 |  Son of man, set thy face  against Sidon, and prophesy against it,   
22 |   and say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, O Sidon;  and I will be glorified in thee; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, when I  have wrought judgments in thee, and I will be sanctified in thee.    
23 |  Blood and death <i>shall be</i> in thy  streets; and <i>men</i> wounded with swords shall fall in thee and on every side  of thee; and they shall know that I am the Lord.   
24 |   And there shall no more be in the house of Israel a thorn of  bitterness and a pricking briar proceeding from them that are round about them,  who dishonoured them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.    
25 |  Thus saith the Lord God; I will also  gather Israel from the nations, among whom they have been scattered, and I will  be sanctified among them, and before the peoples and nations: and they shall  dwell upon their land, which I gave to my servant Jacob.   
 26 |  Yea, they shall dwell upon it safely, and they shall  build houses, and plant vineyards, and dwell securely, when I shall execute  judgment on all that have dishonoured them, <i>even</i> on those <i>that are</i>  round about them; and they shall know that I am the Lord their God, and the God  of their fathers.   Chapter  29

1 |  In the twelfth year, in the tenth  month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
2 |  Son of man, set thy face  against Pharao king of Egypt, and prophesy against him, and against the whole of  Egypt:   
3 |  and say,    Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against Pharao, the great  dragon that lies in the midst of his rivers, that says, The rivers are mine, and  I made them.   
4 |  And I will put hooks  in thy jaws, and I will cause the fish of thy river to stick to thy sides, and I  will bring thee up out of the midst of thy river:   
5 |   and I will quickly cast down thee and all the fish of thy river:  thou shalt fall on the face of the plain, and shalt by no means be gathered, and  shalt not be brought together: I have given thee for food to the wild beasts of  the earth and to the fowls of the sky.   
6 |   And all the dwellers in Egypt shall know that I am the Lord,  because thou hast been a staff of reed to the house of Israel.    
7 |  When they took hold of thee with their  hand, thou didst break: and when every hand was clapped against them, and when  they leaned on thee, thou wast utterly broken, and didst crush the loins of them  all.  
8 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold,  I <i>will</i> bring a sword upon thee, and will cut off from thee man and beast;   
9 |  and the land of Egypt shall be  ruined and desert; and they shall know that I am the Lord; because thou sayest,  The rivers are mine, and I made them.    
10 |  Therefore, behold, I am against thee,  and against all thy rivers, and I will give up the land of Egypt to desolation,  and the sword, and destruction, from Magdol and Syene even to the borders of the  Ethiopians.   
11 |  No foot of man shall  pass through it, and no foot of beast shall pass through it, and it shall not be  inhabited for forty years.    
12 |  And I will cause her land to be  utterly destroyed in the midst of a land that is desolate, and her cities shall  be <i>desolate</i> forty years in the midst of cities that are desolate: and I  will disperse Egypt among the nations, and will utterly scatter them into the  countries.    
13 |  Thus saith the Lord; After forty  years I will gather the Egyptians from the nations among whom they have been  scattered;   
14 |  and I will turn the  captivity of the Egyptians, and will cause them to dwell in the land of  Phathore, in the land whence they were taken;   
15 |   and it shall be a base kingdom beyond all <i>other</i> kingdoms;  it shall not any more be exalted over the nations; and I will make them few in  number, that they may not be <i>great</i> among the nations.    
16 |  And they shall no more be to the house  of Israel a confidence bringing iniquity to remembrance, when they follow after  them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  
17 |  And it came to pass in the  twenty-seventh year, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the Lord  came to me, saying,    
18 |  Son of man, Nabuchodonosor king of  Babylon caused his army to serve a great service against Tyre; every head was  bald, and every shoulder peeled; yet there was no reward to him or to his army <i>serving</i> against Tyre, nor for the service wherewith they served against  it.    
19 |  Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I <i> will</i> give to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon the land of Egypt, and he shall  take the plunder thereof, and seize the spoils thereof; and <i>it</i> shall be a  reward for his army.   
20 |  In return  for his service wherewith he served against Tyre, I have given him the land of  Egypt; thus saith the Lord God:    
21 |  In that day shall a horn spring forth  for all the house of Israel, and I will give thee an open mouth in the midst of  them; and they shall know that I am the Lord.   Chapter  30     

#30
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, prophesy,  and say, Thus saith the Lord; Woe, woe <i>worth</i> the day!    
3 |  For the day of the Lord is nigh, a day of  cloud; it shall be the end of the nations.    
4 |  And the sword shall come upon the  Egyptians, and there shall be tumult in Ethiopia, and in Egypt <i>men</i> shall  fall down slain together, and her foundations shall fall.   
 5 |  Persians, and Cretans, and Lydians, and Libyans, and all  the mixed multitude, and they of the children of my covenant, shall fall by the  sword therein.   
6 |  And the supports of  Egypt shall fall; and the pride of her strength shall come down from Magdol to  Syene: they shall fall by the sword in it, saith the Lord.    
7 |  And it shall be made desolate in the  midst of desolate countries, and their cities shall be <i>desolate</i> in the  midst of desolate cities:   
8 |  and they  shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall send fire upon Egypt, and <i>when</i>  all that help her shall be broken.   
9 |   In that day shall messengers go forth hasting to destroy Ethiopia  utterly, and there shall be tumult among them in the day of Egypt: for, behold  it comes.    
10 |  Thus saith the Lord God; I will also  destroy the multitude of the Egyptians by the hand of Nabuchodonosor king of  Babylon,   
11 |  his <i>hand</i> and his  people’s; <i>they are</i> plagues sent forth from the nations to destroy the  land: and they all shall unsheath their swords against Egypt, and the land shall  be filled with slain.   
12 |  And I will  make their rivers desolate, and will destroy the land and the fulness of it by  the hands of strangers: I the Lord have spoken.    
13 |  For thus saith the Lord God; I will  also destroy the nobles from Memphis, and the princes of Memphis out of the land  of Egypt; and they shall be no more.   
14 |   And I will destroy the land of Phathore, and will send fire upon  Tanis, and will execute vengeance on Diospolis.   
15 |   And I will pour out my wrath upon Sais the strength of Egypt, and  will destroy the multitude of Memphis.   
16 |   And I will send fire upon Egypt; and Syene shall be sorely  troubled; and there shall be a breaking in Diospolis, and waters shall be poured  out.   
17 |  The youths of Heliopolis and  Bubastum shall fall by the sword, and the women shall go into captivity.    
18 |  And the day shall be darkened in  Taphnae, when I have broken there the scepters of Egypt: and the pride of her  strength shall perish there: and a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters  shall be taken prisoners.   
19 |  And I  will execute judgment on Egypt; and they shall know that I am the Lord.  
20 |  And it came to pass in the eleventh  year, in the first month, on the seventh <i>day</i> of the month, the word of  the Lord came to me, saying,   
21 |  Son  of man, I have broken the arms of Pharao, king of Egypt; and, behold, it has not  been bound up to be healed, to have a plaster put upon it, <i>or</i> to be  strengthened to lay hold of the sword.   
22 |   Therefore thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against Pharao  king of Egypt, and I will break his strong and outstretched arms, and will smite  down his sword out of his hand.   
23 |   And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations, and will utterly scatter  them among the countries.    
24 |  And I will strengthen the arms of the  king of Babylon, and put my sword into his hand: and he shall bring it upon  Egypt, and shall take her plunder and seize her spoils.   
25 |  Yea, I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon,  and the arms of Pharao shall fail: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when  I have put my sword into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall stretch  it out over the land of Egypt.   
26 |   And I will disperse the Egyptians among the nations, and utterly scatter them  among the countries; and they all shall know that I am the Lord.   Chapter  31   

#31
1 |  And it came to pass in the eleventh  year, in the third month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the  Lord came to me, saying,   
2 |  Son of  man, say to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his multitude;    To whom hast thou compared thyself in thy haughtiness?    
3 |  Behold, the Assyrian was a cypress in  Libanus, and was fair in shoots, and high in stature: his top reached to the  midst of the clouds.   
4 |  The water  nourished him, the depth made him grow tall; she led her rivers round about his  plants, and she sent forth her streams to all the trees of the field.    
5 |  Therefore was his stature exalted above  all the trees of the field, and his branches spread far by the help of much  water.   
6 |  All the birds of the sky  made their nests in his boughs, and under his branches all the wild beasts of  the field bred; the whole multitude of nations dwelt under his shadow.    
7 |  And he was fair in his height by reason  of the multitude of his branches: for his roots were amidst much water.    
8 |  And such cypresses <i>as this</i> were in  the paradise of God; and there were no pines like his shoots, and there were no  firs like his branches: no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his  beauty,   
9 |  because of the multitude  of his branches: and the trees of God’s paradise of delight envied him.  
10 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord;  Because thou art grown great, and hast set thy top in the midst of the clouds,  and I saw when he was exalted;   
11 |   therefore I delivered him into the hands of the prince of the nations, and he  wrought his destruction.   
12 |  And  ravaging strangers from the nations have destroyed him, and have cast him down  upon the mountains: his branches fell in all the valleys, and his boughs were  broken in every field of the land; and all the people of the nations are gone  down from their shelter, and have laid him low.    
13 |  All the birds of the sky have settled  on his fallen trunk, and all the wild beasts of the field came upon his boughs:   
14 |  in order that none of the trees  by the water should exalt themselves by reason of their size: whereas they set  their top in the midst of the clouds, yet they continued not in their high state  in their place, all that drank water, all were consigned to death, to the depth  of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down to the  pit.    
15 |  Thus saith the Lord God; In the day  wherein he went down to Hades, the deep mourned for him: and I stayed her  floods, and restrained her abundance of water: and Libanus saddened for him, all  the trees of the field fainted for him.   
16 |   At the sound of his fall the nations quaked, when I brought him  down to Hades with them that go down to the pit: and all the trees of Delight  comforted him in the heart, and the choice of <i>plants</i> of Libanus, all that  drink water.   
17 |  For they went down  to hell with him among the slain with the sword; and his seed, <i>even</i> they  that dwelt under his shadow, perished in the midst of their life.    
18 |  To whom art thou compared? descend,  and be thou debased with the trees of paradise to the depth of the earth: thou  shalt lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the  sword. Thus shall Pharao be, and the multitude of his host, saith the Lord God.   Chapter  32     

#32
1 |  And it came to pass in the twelfth  year, in the tenth month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, <i>that</i> the  word of the Lord came to me, saying,   
2 |   Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharao king of Egypt, and  say to him,    Thou art become like a lion of the nations, and as a serpent  that is in the sea: and thou didst make assaults with thy rivers, and didst  disturb the water with thy feet, and didst trample thy rivers.    
3 |  Thus saith the Lord; I will also cast  over thee the nets of many nations, and will bring thee up with my hook:    
4 |  and I will stretch thee upon the earth:  the fields shall be covered <i>with thee</i>, and I will cause all the birds of  the sky to settle upon thee, and I will fill <i>with thee</i> all the wild  beasts of the earth.   
5 |  And I will  cast thy flesh upon the mountains, and will saturate <i>them</i> with thy blood.   
6 |  And the land shall be drenched  with thy dung, because of thy multitude upon the mountains: I will fill the  valleys with thee.   
7 |  And I will veil  the heavens when thou art extinguished, and will darken the stars thereof; I  will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light.    
8 |  All the <i>bodies</i> that give light in  the sky, shall be darkened over thee, and I will bring darkness upon the earth,  saith the Lord God.    
9 |  And I will provoke to anger the heart  of many people, when I shall lead thee captive among the nations, to a land  which thou hast not known.   
10 |  And  many nations shall mourn over thee, and their kings shall be utterly amazed,  when my sword flies in their faces, as they wait for their <i>own</i> fall from  the day of thy fall.    
11 |  For thus saith the Lord God; The  sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee,   
12 |  with the swords of mighty men; and I will cast down thy  strength: <i>they are</i> all destroying ones from the nations, and they shall  destroy the pride of Egypt, and all her strength shall be crushed.    
13 |  And I will destroy all her cattle from <i>beside</i> the great water; and the foot of man shall not trouble it any  more, and the step of cattle shall no more trample it.   
14 |  Thus shall their waters then be at rest, and their rivers  shall flow like oil, saith the Lord,   
15 |   when I shall give up Egypt to destruction, and the land shall be  made desolate with the fullness thereof; when I shall scatter all that dwell in  it, and they shall know that I am the Lord.   
16 |   There is a lamentation, and thou shalt utter it; and the  daughters of the nations shall utter it, <i>even</i> for Egypt, and they shall  mourn for it over all the strength thereof, saith the Lord God.  
17 |  And it came to pass in the twelfth  year, in the first month, on the fifteenth <i>day</i> of the month, the word of  the Lord came to me, saying,    
18 |  Son of man, lament over the strength  of Egypt, for the nations shall bring down her daughters dead to the depth of  the earth, to them that go down to the pit.   
19 20 |   They shall fall with him in the midst of them <i>that are</i>  slain with the sword, and all his strength shall perish: the giants also shall  say to thee,   
21 |  Be thou in the depth  of the pit: to whom art thou superior? yea, go down, and lie with the  uncircumcised, in the midst of them <i>that are</i> slain with the sword.     
22 |  There are Assur and all his company:  all <i>his</i> slain have been laid there:   
23 |   and their burial is in the depth of the pit, and his company are  set around about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, who had caused  the fear of them <i>to be</i> upon the land of the living.    
24 |  There is Ælam and all his host round  about his tomb: all the slain that fell by the sword, and the uncircumcised that  go down to the deep of the earth, who caused their fear to be upon the land of  the living: and they have received their punishment with them that go down to  the pit,   
25 |  in the midst of the  slain.    
26 |  There were laid Mosoch, and Thobel,  and all his strength round about his tomb: all his slain men, all the  uncircumcised, slain with the sword, who caused their fear to be in the land of  the living.   
27 |  And they are laid  with the giants that fell of old, who went down to Hades with <i>their</i>  weapons of war: and they laid their swords under their heads, but their  iniquities were upon their bones, because they terrified all men during their  life.   
28 |  And thou shalt lie in the  midst of the uncircumcised, with them that have been slain by the sword.     
29 |  There are laid the princes of Assur,  who yielded their strength to a wound of the sword: these are laid with the  slain, with them that go down to the pit.    
30 |  There are the princes of the north, <i>even</i> all the captains of Assur, who go down slain <i>to Hades</i>: they  lie uncircumcised among the slain with the sword together with their terror and  their strength, and they have received their punishment with them that go down  to the pit.    
31 |  King Pharao shall see them, and shall  be comforted over all their force, saith the Lord God.   
32 |  For I have caused his fear to be upon the land of the  living yet he shall lie in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are  slain with the sword, <i>even</i> Pharao, and all his multitude with him, saith  the Lord God.   Chapter  33     

#33
1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, speak to  the children of thy people, and thou shalt say to them,    On whatsoever land I shall bring a sword, and the people of  the land take one man of them, and set him for their watchman:    
3 |  and he shall see the sword coming upon  the land, and blow the trumpet, and sound an alarm to the people;    
4 |  and he that hears the sound of the  trumpet shall hear <i>indeed</i>, and <i>yet</i> not take heed, and the sword  shall come upon him, and overtake him, his blood shall be upon his <i>own</i>  head.   
5 |  Because he heard the sound  of the trumpet, and took no heed, his blood shall be upon him: but the other,  because he took heed, has delivered his soul.    
6 |  But if the watchman see the sword  coming, and do not sound the trumpet, and the people do not watch; and the sword  come, and take a soul from among them, that <i>soul</i> is taken because of its  iniquity; but the blood <i>thereof</i> will I require at the watchman’s hand.    
7 |  And thou, son of man, I have set thee <i>as</i> a watchman to the house of Israel, and thou shalt hear a word from my  mouth.   
8 |  When I say to the sinner,  Thou shalt surely die; <i>if</i> thou speak not to warn the wicked from his way,  the wicked himself shall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at  thine hand.   
9 |  But if thou forewarn  the wicked of his way to turn from it, and he turn not from his way, he shall  die in his ungodliness; but thou hast delivered thine own soul.  
10 |  And thou, son of man, say to the  house of Israel; Thus have ye spoken, saying, Our errors, and our iniquities  weigh upon us, and we pine away in them, and how then shall we live?    
11 |  Say to them, Thus saith the Lord; <i>As</i>  I live, I desire not the death of the ungodly, as that the ungodly should turn  from his way and live: turn ye heartily from your way; for why will ye die, O  house of Israel?    
12 |  Say to the children of thy people,  The righteousness of the righteous shall not deliver him, in the day wherein he  errs: and the iniquity of the ungodly shall not harm him, in the day wherein he  turns from his iniquity, but the righteous <i>erring</i> shall not be able to  deliver himself.    
13 |  When I say to the righteous, <i>Thou  shalt live; and</i> he trusts in his righteousness, and shall commit iniquity,  none of his righteousnesses shall be remembered; in his unrighteousness which he  has wrought, in it shall he die.    
14 |  And when I say to the ungodly, Thou  shalt surely die; and he shall turn from his sin, and do judgment and justice,   
15 |  and return the pledge, and repay  that which he has robbed, <i>and</i> walk in the ordinances of life, so as to do  no wrong; he shall surely live, and shall not die.   
16 |  None of his sins which he has committed shall be  remembered: because he has wrought judgment and righteousness; by them shall he  live.    
17 |  Yet the children of thy people will  say, The way of the Lord is not straight: whereas this their way is not  straight.   
18 |  When the righteous  turns away from his righteousness, and shall commit iniquities, then shall he  die in them.   
19 |  And when the sinner  turns from his iniquity, and shall do judgment and righteousness, he shall live  by them.   
20 |  And this is that which  ye said, The way of the Lord is <i>not</i> straight. I will judge you, O house  of Israel, every one for his ways.    
21 |  And it came to pass in the tenth year  of our captivity, in the twelfth month, on the fifth <i>day</i> of the month, <i> that</i> one that had escaped from Jerusalem came to me, saying, The city is  taken.   
22 |  Now the hand of the Lord  had come upon me in the evening, before he came; and he opened my mouth, when he  came to me in the morning: and my mouth was open, it was no longer kept closed.    
23 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
24 |  Son of man, they that  inhabit the desolate <i>places</i> on the land of Israel say, Abram was one, and  he possessed the land: and we are more numerous; to us the land is given for a  possession.    
25 26 27 |  Therefore say to them, Thus  saith the Lord God, <i>As</i> I live, surely they that are in the desolate  places shall fall by swords and they that are in the open plain shall be given  for food to the wild beasts of the field, and them that are in the fortified <i> cities</i> and them that are in the caves I will slay with pestilence.    
28 |  And I will make the land desert, and the  pride of her strength shall perish; and the mountains of Israel shall be made  desolate by reason of no man passing through.   
29 |   And they shall know that I am the Lord; and I will make their  land desert, and it shall be made desolate because of all their abominations  which they have wrought.  
30 |  And <i>as for</i> thee, son of man,  the children of thy people are they that speak concerning thee by the walls, and  in the porches of the houses, and they talk one to another, saying, Let us come  together, and let us hear the <i>words</i> that proceed from the Lord.    
31 |  They approach thee as a people comes  together, and sit before thee, and hear thy words, but they will not do them:  for <i>there is</i> falsehood in their mouth, and their heart <i>goes</i> after  their pollutions.   
32 |  And thou art to  them as a sound of a sweet, well-tuned psaltery, and they will hear thy words,  but they will not do them.   
33 |  But  whenever it shall come <i>to pass</i>, they will say, Behold, it is come: and  they shall know that there was a prophet in the midst of them.   Chapter  34

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, prophesy  against the shepherds of Israel, prophesy, and say to the shepherds,    Thus saith the Lord God; O shepherds of Israel, do shepherds  feed themselves? do not the shepherds feed the sheep?   
3 |  Behold, ye feed on the milk, and clothe yourselves with  the wool, and slay the fat: but ye feed not my sheep.   
4 |  The weak one ye have not strengthened, and the sick ye  have not cherished, and the bruised ye have not bound up, and the stray one ye  have not turned back, and the lost ye have not sought; and the strong ye have  wearied with labour.   
5 |  And my sheep  were scattered, because there were no shepherds: and they became meat to all the  wild beasts of the field.   
6 |  And my  sheep were scattered on every mountain, and on every high hill: yea, they were  scattered on the face of the earth, and there was none to seek them out, nor to  bring them back.  
7 |  Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word  of the Lord.   
8 |  <i>As</i> I live,  saith the Lord God, surely because my sheep became a prey, and my sheep became  meat to all the wild beasts of the field, because there were no shepherds, and  the shepherds sought not out my sheep, and the shepherds fed themselves, but fed  not my sheep.   
9 |  For this cause, O  shepherds,   
10 |  thus saith the Lord  God, Behold, I am against the shepherds; and I will require my sheep at their  hands, and will turn them back that they shall not feed my sheep, and the  shepherds shall no longer feed them; and I will deliver my sheep out of their  mouth, and they shall no longer be meat for them.    
11 |  For thus saith the Lord God, Behold,  I will seek out my sheep, and will visit them.   
12 |   As the shepherd seeks his flock, in the day when there is  darkness and cloud, in the midst of the sheep that are separated: so will I seek  out my sheep, and will bring them back from every place where they were  scattered in the day of cloud and darkness.   
13 |   And I will bring them out from the Gentiles, and will gather them  from the countries, and will bring them into their own land, and will feed them  upon the mountains of Israel, and in the valleys, and in every inhabited place  of the land.   
14 |  I will feed them in  a good pasture, on a high mountain of Israel: and their folds shall be there,  and they shall lie down, and there shall they rest in perfect prosperity, and  they shall feed in a fat pasture on the mountains of Israel.    
15 |  I will feed my sheep, and I will cause  them to rest; and they shall know that I am the Lord: thus saith the Lord God.   
16 |  I will seek that which is lost,  and I will recover the stray one, and will bind up that which was broken, and  will strengthen the fainting, and will guard the strong, and will feed them with  judgment.  
17 |  And <i>as for</i> you, ye sheep, thus  saith the Lord God, Behold, I will distinguish between sheep and sheep, <i> between</i> rams and he-goats.   
18 |   And <i>is it</i> not enough for you that ye fed on the good pasture, that ye  trampled with your feet the remnant of your pasture? and <i>that</i> ye drank  the standing water, <i>that</i> ye disturbed the residue with your feet?    
19 |  So my sheep fed on that which ye had  trampled with your feet; and they drank the water that had been disturbed by  your feet.    
20 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord God;  Behold, I will separate between the strong sheep and the weak sheep.    
21 |  Ye did thrust with your sides and  shoulders, and pushed with your horns, and ye cruelly treated all the sick.   
22 |  Therefore I will save my sheep,  and they shall not be any more for a prey; and will judge between ram and ram.    
23 |  And I will raise up one shepherd over  them, and he shall tend them, <i>even</i> my servant David, and he shall be  their shepherd;   
24 |  and I the Lord  will be to them a God, and David a prince in the midst of them; I the Lord have  spoken it.   
25 |  And I will make with  David a covenant of peace and I will utterly destroy evil beasts from off the  land; and they shall dwell in the wilderness, and sleep in the forests.    
26 |  And I will settle them round about my  mountain; and I will give you the rain, the rain of blessing.    
27 |  And the trees that are in the field  shall yield their fruit, and the earth shall yield her strength, and they shall  dwell in the confidence of peace on their land, and they shall know that I am  the Lord, when I have broken their yoke; and I will deliver them out of the hand  of those that enslaved them.   
28 |  And  they shall no more be a spoil to the nations, and the wild beasts of the land  shall no more at all devour them; and they shall dwell safely, and there shall  be none to make them afraid.   
29 |  And  I will raise up for them a plant of peace, and they shall no more perish with  hunger upon the land, and they shall no more bear the reproach of the nations.    
30 |  And they shall know that I am the  Lord their God, and they my people. O house of Israel, saith the Lord God,   
31 |  ye are my sheep, even the sheep  of my flock, and I am the Lord your God, saith the Lord God.   Chapter  35

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, set thy  face against mount Seir, and prophesy against it,   
3 |   and say to it,    Thus saith the Lord God; Behold, I am against thee, O mount  Seir, and I will stretch out my hand against thee, and will make thee a waste,  and thou shalt be made desolate.   
4 |   And I will cause desolation in thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate, and thou  shalt know that I am the Lord.   
5 |   Because thou hast been a perpetual enemy, and hast laid wait craftily for the  house of Israel, with the hand of enemies with a sword, in the time of  injustice, at the last:    
6 |  Therefore, as I live, saith the Lord  God, verily thou hast sinned even to blood, therefore blood shall pursue thee.   
7 |  And I will make mount Seir a  waste, and desolate, and I will destroy from off it men and cattle:    
8 |  and I will fill thy hills and thy valleys  with slain men, and in all thy plains there shall fall in thee men slain with  the sword.   
9 |  I will make thee a  perpetual desolation, and thy cities shall not be inhabited any more: and thou  shalt know that I am the Lord.  
10 |  Because thou saidst, The two nations  and the two countries shall be mine, and I shall inherit them; whereas the Lord  is there:   
11 |  therefore, <i>as</i> I  live, saith the Lord, I will even deal with thee according to thine enmity, and  I will be made known to thee when I shall judge thee:   
12 |  and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. I have heard the  voice of thy blasphemies, whereas thou hast said, The desert mountains of Israel  are given to us for food;   
13 |  and  thou hast spoken swelling words against me with thy mouth: I have heard <i>them</i>.    
14 |  Thus saith the Lord; When all the  earth is rejoicing, I will make thee desert.   
15 |   Thou shalt be desert, O mount Seir, and all Idumea; and it shall  be utterly consumed: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord their God.   Chapter  36     

#36
1 |  And thou, son of man, prophesy to  the mountains of Israel, and say to the mountains of Israel, Hear ye the word of  the Lord:    
2 |  Thus saith the Lord God; Because the  enemy has said against you, Aha, the old waste places are become a possession  for us:   
3 |  therefore prophesy, and  say, Thus saith the Lord God; Because ye have been dishonoured, and hated by  those round about you, that ye might be a possession to the remainder of the  nations, and ye became a by-word, and a reproach to the nations:    
4 |  therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear  the word of the Lord; Thus saith the Lord to the mountains, and to the hills,  and to the streams, and to the valleys, and to <i>the places</i> that have been  made desolate and destroyed, and to the cities that have been deserted, and have  become a spoil and a trampling to the nations that were left round about;    
5 |  therefore, thus saith the Lord; Verily in  the fire of my wrath have I spoken against the rest of the nations, and against  all Idumea, because they have appropriated my land to themselves for a  possession with joy, disregarding the lives <i>of the inhabitants</i>, to  destroy <i>it</i> by plunder:   
6 |   therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and  to the hills, and to the valleys, and to the forests, Thus saith the Lord;  Behold, I have spoken in my jealousy and in my wrath, because ye have borne the  reproaches of the heathen:   
7 |   therefore I will lift up my hand against the nations that are round about you;  they shall bear their reproach.    
8 |  But your grapes and your fruits, O  mountains of Israel, shall my people eat; for they are hoping to come.    
9 |  For, behold, I am toward you, and I will  have respect to you, and ye shall be tilled and sown:   
10 |  and I will multiply men upon you, <i>even</i> all the  house of Israel to the end: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the desolate  land shall be built upon.   
11 |  And I  will multiply men and cattle upon you; and I will cause you to dwell as at the  beginning, and will treat you well, as in your former <i>times</i>: and ye shall  know that I am the Lord.   
12 |  And I  will increase men upon you, <i>even</i> my people Israel; and they shall inherit  you, and ye shall be to them for a possession; and ye shall no more be bereaved  of them.    
13 |  Thus saith the Lord God: Because they  said to thee, Thou <i>land</i> devourest men, and hast been bereaved of thy  nation;   
14 |  therefore thou shalt no  more devour men, and thou shalt no more bereave thy nation, saith the Lord God.   
15 |  And there shall no more be heard  against you the reproach of the nations, and ye shall no more bear the revilings  of the peoples, saith the Lord God.  
16 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
17 |  Son of man, the house of  Israel dwelt upon their land, and defiled it by their way, and with their idols,  and with their uncleannesses; and their way was before me like the uncleanness  of a removed woman.   
18 |  So I poured  out my wrath upon them:   
19 |  and I  dispersed them among the nations, and utterly scattered them through the  countries: I judged them according to their way and according to their sin.   
20 |  And they went in among the  nations, among which they went, and they profaned my holy name, while it was  said of them, These are the people of the Lord, and they came forth out of his  land.   
21 |  But I spared them for the  sake of my holy name, which the house of Israel profaned among the nations,  among whom they went.    
22 |  Therefore say to the house of Israel,  Thus saith the Lord; I do not this, O house of Israel, for your sakes, but  because of my holy name, which ye have profaned among the nations, among whom ye  went.   
23 |  And I will sanctify my  great name, which was profaned among the nations, which ye profaned in the midst  of them; and the nations shall know that I am the Lord, when I am sanctified  among you before their eyes.    
24 |  And I will take you out from the  nations, and will gather you out of all the lands, and will bring you into your  own land:   
25 |  and I will sprinkle  clean water upon you, and ye shall be purged from all your uncleannesses, and  from all your idols, and I will cleanse you.   
26 |   And I will give you a new heart, and will put a new spirit in  you: and I will take away the heart of stone out of your flesh, and will give  you a heart of flesh.   
27 |  And I will  put my Spirit in you, and will cause you to walk in mine ordinances, and to keep  my judgments, and do <i>them</i>.   
28 |   And ye shall dwell upon the land which I gave to your fathers;  and ye shall be to me a people, and I will be to you a God.    
29 |  And I will save you from all your  uncleannesses: and I will call for the corn, and multiply it, and will not bring  famine upon you.   
30 |  And I will  multiply the fruit of the trees, and the produce of the field, that ye may not  bear the reproach of famine among the nations.    
31 |  And ye shall remember your evil ways  and your practices that were not good, and ye shall be hateful in your own sight  for your transgressions and for your abominations.   
32 |  Not for your sakes do I <i>this</i>, saith the Lord God, <i>as</i> it is known to you: be ye ashamed and confounded for your ways, O  house of Israel.    
33 |  Thus saith the Lord God; In the day  wherein I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities I will also cause the  cities to be inhabited, and the waste <i>places</i> shall be built upon:    
34 |  and the desolate land shall be  cultivated, whereas it was desolate in the eyes of every one that passed by.   
35 |  And they shall say, That desolate  land is become like a garden of delight; and the waste and desolate and ruined  cities are inhabited.   
36 |  And the  nations, as many as shall have been left round about you, shall know that I the  Lord have built the ruined <i>cities</i> and planted the waste <i>lands</i>: I  the Lord have spoken, and will do <i>it</i>.    
37 |  Thus saith the Lord God; Yet <i>for</i>  this will I be sought by the house of Israel, to establish them; I will multiply  them <i>even</i> men as sheep;   
38 |  as  holy sheep, as the sheep of Jerusalem in her feasts; thus shall the desert  cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord.   Chapter  37

1 |  And the hand of the Lord came upon  me, and the Lord brought me forth by the Spirit, and set me in the midst of the  plain, and it was full of human bones.   
2 |   And he led me round about them every way: and, behold, <i>there  were</i> very many on the face of the plain, very dry.    
3 |  And he said to me, Son of man, will  these bones live? and I said, O Lord God, thou knowest this.    
4 |  And he said to me, Prophesy upon these  bones, and thou shalt say to them, Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord.   
5 |  Thus saith the Lord to these  bones; Behold, I <i>will</i> bring upon you the breath of life:    
6 |  and I will lay sinews upon you, and will  bring up flesh upon you, and will spread skin upon you, and will put my Spirit  into you, and ye shall live; and ye shall know that I am the Lord.    
7 |  So I prophesied as <i>the Lord</i>  commanded me: and it came to pass while I was prophesying, that, behold, <i> there was</i> a shaking, and the bones approached each one to his joint.    
8 |  And I looked, and behold, sinews and  flesh grew upon them, and skin came upon them above: but there was not breath in  them.   
9 |  And he said to me, Prophesy  to the wind, prophesy, son of man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord;  Come from the four winds, and breathe upon these dead <i>men</i>, and let them  live.   
10 |  So I prophesied as he  commanded me, and the breath entered into them, and they lived, and stood upon  their feet, a very great congregation.    
11 |  And the Lord spoke to me, saying, Son  of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel: and they say, Our bones are  become dry, our hope has perished, we are quite spent.   
12 |  Therefore prophesy and say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> open your tombs, and will bring you up out of your tombs, and will  bring you into the land of Israel.   
13 |   And ye shall know that I am the Lord, when I have opened your  graves, that I may bring up my people from <i>their</i> graves.    
14 |  And I will put my Spirit within you, and  ye shall live, and I will place you upon your own land: and ye shall know that I <i>am</i> the Lord; I have spoken, and will do <i>it</i>, saith the Lord.  
15 |  And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,   
16 |  Son of man, take for  thyself a rod, and write upon it, Juda, and the children of Israel his  adherents; and thou shalt take for thyself another rod, and thou shalt inscribe  it for Joseph, the rod of Ephraim, and all the children of Israel that belong to  him.   
17 |  And thou shalt joint them  together for thyself, so as that they should bind themselves into one stick; and  they shall be in thine hand.    
18 |  And it shall come to pass, when the  children of thy people shall say to thee, Wilt thou not tell us what thou  meanest by these things?   
19 |  Then  shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the Lord; behold, I will take the tribe of  Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that belong to  him, and I will add them to the tribe of Juda, and they shall become one rod in  the hand of Juda.   
20 |  And the rods on  which thou didst write shall be in thine hand in their presence.    
21 |  And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith  the Lord God; Behold, I <i>will</i> take the whole house of Israel out of the  midst of the nations, among whom they have gone, and I will gather them from all  that are round about them, and I will bring them into the land of Israel.    
22 |  And I will make them a nation in my  land, even on the mountains of Israel; and they shall have one prince: and they  shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided any more at all into  two kingdoms:   
23 |  that they may no  more defile themselves with their idols; and I will deliver them from all their  transgressions whereby they have sinned, and will cleanse them; and they shall  be to me a people, and I the Lord will be to them a God.    
24 |  And my servant David <i>shall be</i>  a prince in the midst of them: there shall be one shepherd of <i>them</i> all;  for they shall walk in mine ordinances, and keep my judgments, and do them.   
25 |  And they shall dwell in their  land, which I have given to my servant Jacob, where their fathers dwelt; and  they shall dwell upon it: and David my servant <i>shall be their</i> prince  forever.    
26 |  And I will make with them a covenant  of peace; it shall be an everlasting covenant with them; and I will establish my  sanctuary in the midst of them for ever.   
27 |   And my tabernacle shall be among them; and I will be to them a  God, and they shall be my people.   
28 |   And the nations shall know that I am the Lord that sanctifies  them, when my sanctuary is in the midst of them for ever.   Chapter  38

1 |  And the word of the Lord came to  me, saying,   
2 |  Son of man, set thy  face against Gog, and the land of Magog, Rhos, prince of Mesoch and Thobel, and  prophesy against him,   
3 |  and say to  him, Thus saith the Lord God;    Behold, I am against thee, Rhos prince of Mesoch and Thobel:   
4 |  and I will gather thee, and all  thine host, horses and horsemen, all wearing breast-plates, with a great  multitude, shields and helmets and swords:   
5 |   Persians, and Ethiopians, and Libyans; all with helmets and  shields.   
6 |  Gomer, and all belonging  to him; the house of Thorgama, from the end of the north, and all belonging to  him; and many nations with thee.    
7 |  Be thou prepared, prepare thyself,  thou, and all thy multitude that is assembled with thee, and thou shalt be to me  for a guard.   
8 |  He shall be prepared  after many days, and he shall come at the end of years, and shall come to a land  that is brought back from the sword, when <i>the people</i> are gathered from  many nations against the land of Israel, which was entirely desolate: and he is  come forth out of the nations, and they shall all dwell securely.    
9 |  And thou shalt go up as rain, and shalt  arrive as a cloud to cover the land, and there shall be thou, and all that are  about thee, and many nations with thee.    
10 |  Thus saith the Lord God; It shall  also come to pass in that day, that thoughts shall come up into thine heart, and  thou shalt devise evil devices.   
11 |   And thou shalt say, I will go up to the rejected land; I will come upon them  that are at ease in tranquility, and dwelling in peace, all inhabiting a land in  which there is no wall, nor bars, nor have they doors;   
12 |  to seize plunder, and to take their spoil; to turn my  hands against the desolate land that is <i>now</i> inhabited, and against a  nation that is gathered from many nations, that have acquired property, dwelling  in the midst of the land.   
13 |  Sabba,  and Daedan, and Carthaginian merchants, and all their villages shall say to  thee, Thou art come for plunder to take a prey, and to get spoils: thou hast  gathered thy multitude to take silver and gold, to carry off property, to take  spoils.  
14 |  Therefore prophesy, son of man, and  say to Gog, Thus saith the Lord; Wilt thou not arise in that day, when my people  Israel are dwelling securely,   
15 |  and  come out of thy place from the farthest north, and many nations with thee? all  of them mounted on horses, a great gathering, and a large force?    
16 |  And thou shalt come up upon my people  Israel as a cloud to cover the land; it shall come to pass in the last days,  that I will bring thee up upon my land, that all the nations may know me, when I  am sanctified in thee before them.    
17 |  Thus saith the Lord God, to Gog; Thou  art <i>he</i> concerning whom I spoke in former times, by the hand of my  servants the prophets of Israel, in those days and years, that I would bring  thee up against them.   
18 |  And it  shall come to pass in that day, in the day when Gog shall come against the land  of Israel, saith the Lord God,   
19 |   <i>that</i> my wrath and my jealousy shall arise, I have spoken in the fire of  mine anger, verily in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of  Israel;   
20 |  and the fish of the sea  shall quake at the presence of the Lord, and the birds of the sky and the wild  beasts of the field, and all the reptiles that creep upon the earth, and all the  men that are on the face of the earth; and the mountains shall be rent, and the  valleys shall fall, and every wall on the land shall fall.    
21 |  And I will summon against it even every  fear, saith the Lord: the sword of <i>every</i> man shall be against his  brother.   
22 |  And I will judge him  with pestilence, and blood, and sweeping rain, and hailstones; and I will rain  upon him fire and brimstone, and upon all that are with him, and upon many  nations with him.    
23 |  And I will be magnified, and  sanctified, and glorified; and I will be known in the presence of many nations,  and they shall know that I am the Lord.   Chapter  39   

#39
1 |  And thou, son of man, prophesy  against Gog, and say, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog,  Rhos prince of Mesoch and Thobel:   
2 |   and I will assemble thee, and guide thee, and raise thee up on the extremity of  the north, and I will bring thee up upon the mountains of Israel.    
3 |  And I will destroy the bow out of thy  left hand, and thine arrows out of thy right hand, and I will cast thee down on  the mountains of Israel;   
4 |  and thou  and all that belong to thee shall fall, and the nations that are with thee shall  be given to multitudes of birds, <i>even</i> to every fowl, and I have given  thee to all the wild beasts of the field to be devoured.   
5 |  Thou shalt fall on the face of the field: for I have  spoken <i>it</i>, saith the Lord.    
6 |  And I will send a fire upon Gog, and  the islands shall be securely inhabited: and they shall know that I am the Lord.   
7 |  And my holy name shall be known in  the midst of my people Israel; and my holy name shall no more be profaned: and  the nations shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy <i>One</i> in Israel.    
8 |  Behold it is come, and thou shalt know  that it shall be, saith the Lord God; this is the day concerning which I have  spoken.    
9 |  And they that inhabit the cities of  Israel shall come forth, and make a fire with the arms, the shields and the  spears, and bows and arrows, and hand-staves, and lances, and they shall keep  fire burning with them for seven years:   
10 |   and they shall not take any wood out of the field, neither shall  they cut any out of the forests, but they shall burn the weapons with fire: and  they shall plunder those that plundered them, and spoil those that spoiled them,  saith the Lord.    
11 |  And it shall come to pass <i>that</i>  in that day I will give to Gog a place of renown, a tomb in Israel, the  burial-place of them that approach the sea: and they shall build round about the  outlet of the valley, and there they shall bury Gog and all his multitude: and <i>the place</i> shall then be called the burial-place of Gog.    
12 |  And the house of Israel shall bury them,  that the land may be cleansed in the space of seven months.    
13 |  Yea, all the people of the land shall  bury them; and it shall be to them a <i>place</i> of renown in the day wherein  it was glorified, saith the Lord.   
14 |   And they shall appoint men continually to go over the land, to  bury them that have been left on the face of the earth, to cleanse it after the  space of seven months, and they shall seek <i>them</i> out.    
15 |  And every one that goes through the  land, and sees a man’s bone, shall set up a mark by it, until the buriers shall  have buried it in the valley, the burial place of Gog.   
16 |  For the name of the city <i>shall be</i> Burial-place: so  shall the land be cleansed.    
17 |  And thou, son of man, say, Thus saith  the Lord; Say to every winged bird, and to all the wild beasts of the field,  Gather yourselves, and come; gather yourselves from all <i>places</i> round  about to my sacrifice, which I have made for you, <i>even</i> a great sacrifice  on the mountains of Israel, and ye shall eat flesh, and drink blood.    
18 |  Ye shall eat the flesh of mighty men,  and ye shall drink the blood of princes of the earth, rams, and calves and  goats, and they are all fatted calves.   
19 |   And ye shall eat fat till ye are full, and shall drink wine till  ye are drunken, of my sacrifice which I have prepared for you.    
20 |  And ye shall be filled at my table, <i> eating</i> horse, and rider, and mighty man, and every warrior, saith the Lord.    
21 |  And I will set my glory among you,  and all the nations shall see my judgment which I have wrought, and my hand  which I have brought upon them.   
22 |   And the house of Israel shall know that I am the Lord their God, from this day  and onwards.  
23 |  And all the nations shall know that  the house of Israel were led captive because of their sins, because they  rebelled against me, and I turned away my face from them, and delivered them  into the hands of their enemies, and they all fell by the sword.    
24 |  According to their uncleannesses and  according to their transgressions did I deal with them, and I turned away my  face from them.    
25 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord God,  Now will I turn back captivity in Jacob, and will have mercy on the house of  Israel, and will be jealous for the sake of my holy name.   
 26 |  And they shall bear their reproach, and the iniquity  which they committed when they dwelt upon their land in peace. Yet there shall  be none to terrify <i>them</i>   
27 |   when I have brought them back from the nations, and gathered them out of the  countries of the nations: and I will be sanctified among them in the presence of  the nations.   
28 |  And they shall know  that I am the Lord their God, when I have been manifested to them among the  nations.   
29 |  And I will no more turn  away my face from them, because I have poured out my wrath upon the house of  Israel, saith the Lord God.   Chapter  40

1 |  And it came to pass in the  twenty-fifth year of our captivity, in the first month, on the tenth <i>day</i>  of the month, in the fourteenth year after the taking of the city, in that day  the hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me   
2 |   in a vision of God into the land of Israel, and set me on a very  high mountain, and upon it <i>there was</i> as it were the frame of a city  before <i>me</i>.    
3 |  And he brought me in thither, and,  behold, <i>there was</i> a man, and the appearance of him was as the appearance  of shining brass, and in his hand was a builder’s line, and a measuring reed;  and he stood at the gate.   
4 |  And the  man said to me,    Look with thine eyes at him whom thou hast seen, son of man,  and hear with thine ears, and lay up in thine heart all things that I show thee;  for thou hast come in hither that <i>I</i> might show thee, and thou shalt show  all things that thou seest to the house of Israel.  
5 |  And behold a wall round about the  house without, and in the man’s hand a reed, the measure <i>of it was</i> six  cubits by the cubit, and a span: and he measured across the front wall; the  breadth was equal to the reed, and the length of it equal to the reed.     
6 |  And he entered by seven steps into the  gate that looks eastward, and he measured across the porch of the gate equal to  the reed.   
7 |  And the chamber was  equal in length to the reed, and equal in breadth to the reed; and the porch  between the chambers six cubits; and the second chamber equal in breadth to the  reed, and equal in length to the reed, and the porch five cubits.    
8 |  And the third chamber equal in length to  the reed, and equal in breadth to the reed.   
9 |   And the porch of the gateway (near the porch of the gate) eight  cubits; and the posts there of two cubits; and the porch of the gate was inward:   
10 |  and the chambers of the gate of  the chamber in front <i>were</i> three on one side and three on the other, and <i>there was</i> one measure to the three: <i>there was</i> one measure to the  porches on this side and on that.   
11 |   And he measured the breadth of the door of the gateway, ten  cubits; and the breadth of the gateway thirteen cubits.   
12 |  And the space before the chambers was narrowed to a cubit  in front of the chambers on this side and on that side: and the chamber was six  cubits this way, and six cubits that way.    
13 |  And he measured the gate from the  wall of one chamber to the wall of the other chamber: the breadth was  twenty-five cubits, the one gate over against the other gate.    
14 |  And the open space of the porch of the  gate without, was twenty cubits to the chambers round about the gate.    
15 |  And the open space of the gate without  to the open space of the porch of the gate within was fifty cubits.    
16 |  And <i>there were</i> secret windows  to the chambers, and to the porches within the gate of the court round about,  and in the same manner windows to the porches round about within: and on the  porch <i>there were</i> palm-trees on this side and on that side.    
17 |  And he brought me into the inner  court, and, behold, <i>there were</i> chambers, and peristyles round about the  court; thirty chambers within the ranges of columns.   
18 |  And the porticos were behind the gates; according to the  length of the gates, was the lower peristyle.   
19 |   And he measured the breadth of the court, from the open space of  the outer gate inwards to the open space of the gate looking outwards: a hundred  cubits <i>was the distance to the place</i> of the gate looking eastward: and he  brought me to the north;   
20 |  and  behold a gate looking northwards <i>belonging to</i> the outer court, and he  measured it, both the length of it and the breadth;   
21 |  and the chambers, three on this side and three on that;  and the posts, and the porches, and the palm-trees thereof: and they were  according to the measures of the gate that looks eastward: the length thereof  was fifty cubits, and the breadth thereof was twenty-five cubits.    
22 |  And its windows, and its porches, and  its palm-trees, were according to <i>the dimensions of</i> the gate looking  eastward; and they went up to it by seven steps; and the porches were within.   
23 |  And <i>there was</i> a gate to  the inner court looking toward the north gate, after the manner of the gate  looking toward the east; and he measured the court from gate to gate, a hundred  cubits.    
24 |  And he brought me to the south side,  and behold a gate looking southwards: and he measured it, and its chambers, and  its posts, and its porches, according to these dimensions.    
25 |  And its windows and its porches round  about were according to the windows of the porch: the length thereof was fifty  cubits, and the breadth thereof was five and twenty cubits.    
26 |  And it had seven steps, and porches  within: and it <i>had</i> palm-trees on the posts, one on one side, and one on  the other side.   
27 |  And <i>there was</i>  a gate opposite the gate of the inner court southward: and he measured the court  from gate to gate, a hundred cubits in breadth southward.    
28 |  And he brought me into the inner  court of the south gate: and he measured the gate according to these measures;   
29 |  and the chambers, and the posts,   
30|   and the porches, according to  these measures: and <i>there were</i> windows to it and to the porches round  about: its length was fifty cubits, and <i>its</i> breadth twenty-five cubits,   
31 |  from the porch to the outer  court: and <i>there were</i> palm-trees to the post <i>thereof</i>, and eight  steps.    
32 |  And he brought me in at the gate that  looks eastward: and he measured it according to these measures:    
33 |  and the chambers, and the posts, and the  porches according to these measures: and <i>there were</i> windows to it, and  porches round about: the length of it was fifty cubits, and the breadth of it  twenty-five cubits.   
34 |  And <i>there  were</i> porches <i>opening</i> into the inner court, and palm-trees on the  posts on this side and on that side: and it <i>had</i> eight steps.    
35 |  And he brought me in at the northern  gate, and measured <i>it</i> according to these measures;   
 36 |  and the chambers, and the posts, and the porches: and  it <i>had</i> windows round about, and <i>it had</i> its porches: the length of  it was fifty cubits, and the breadth twenty-five cubits.   
 37 |  And its porches were toward the inner court; and <i> there were</i> palm-trees to the posts on this side and on that side: and it <i> had</i> eight steps.    
38 |  Its chambers and its door-ways, and  its porches at the second gate <i>served as</i> a drain,   
 39 |  that they might slay in it the sin-offerings, and the  trespass-offerings.   
40 |  And behind  the drain for the whole-burnt-offerings at the north <i>gate</i>, two tables  eastward behind the second gate; and <i>behind</i> the porch of the gate two  tables eastward.   
41 |  Four on one side  and four on the other side behind the gate; upon them they kill the victims, in  front of the eight tables of sacrifices.   
42 |   And <i>there were</i> four tables of hewn stone for  whole-burnt-offerings, the breadth <i>of them was</i> a cubit and a half, and  the length <i>of them</i> two cubits <i>and</i> a half, and <i>their</i> height  was a cubit: on them they shall place the instruments with which they slay there  the whole-burnt-offerings and the victims.   
43 |   And they shall have within a border of hewn stone round about of  a span broad, and over the tables above screens for covering <i>them</i> from  the wet and from the heat.    
44 |  And he brought me into the inner  court, and behold <i>there were</i> two chambers in the inner court, one behind  the gate looking to the north, turning southward, and one behind the southern  gate, but which looks to the north.   
45 |   And he said to me, This chamber that looks to the south, is for  the priests that keep the charge of the house.   
46 |   And the chamber that looks to the north is for the priests that  keep the charge of the altar: they are the sons of Sadduc, those of the tribe of  Levi who draw near to the Lord to serve him.    
47 |  And he measured the court, the length <i>whereof was</i> a hundred cubits, and the breadth a hundred cubits, on its  four sides; and the altar in front of the house.   
48 |   And he brought me into the porch of the house; and he measured  the post of the porch, the breadth was five cubits on one side and five cubits  on the other side; and the breadth of the door <i>was</i> fourteen cubits, and  the side-pieces of the door of the porch <i>were</i> three cubits on one side,  and three cubits on the other side.   
49 |   And the length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth  twelve cubits; and they went up to it by ten steps; and <i>there were</i>  pillars to the porch, one on this side and one on that side.   Chapter  41     

#41
1 |  And he brought me into the temple,  the porch of which he measured, six cubits the breadth on one side, and six  cubits the breadth of the porch on the other side.   
2 |  And the breadth of the gateway was ten cubits, and the  side-pieces of the gateway were five cubits on this side, and five cubits on  that side: and he measured the length of it, forty cubits, and the breadth,  twenty cubits.    
3 |  And he went into the inner court, and  measured the post of the door, two cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the  side-pieces of the door, seven cubits on one side, and seven cubits on the other  side.   
4 |  And he measured the length  of the doors, forty cubits; and the breadth, twenty cubits, in front of the  temple: and he said, This is the holy of holies.    
5 |  And he measured the wall of the house,  six cubits: and the breadth of <i>each</i> side, four cubits round about.    
6 |  And the sides were twice ninety, side  against side; and <i>there was</i> a space in the wall of the house at the sides  round about, that they should be for them that take hold of them to see, that  they should not at all touch the walls of the house.   
7 |  And the breadth of the upper side <i>was made</i>  according to the projection out of the wall, against the upper one round about  the house, that it might be enlarged above, and that <i>men</i> might go up to  the upper chambers from those below, and from the ground-sills to the third  story.    
8 |  And as for the height of the house  round about, <i>each</i> space between the sides was equal to a reed of six  cubits;   
9 |  and the breadth of the  wall of each side without was five cubits; and the spaces that were left between  the sides of the house,   
10 |  and  between the chambers, were a width of twenty cubits, the circumference of the  house.    
11 |  And the doors of the chambers were  toward the space left by the one door that looked northward, and <i>there was</i>  one door southward; and the breadth of the remaining open space <i>was</i> five  cubits in extent round about.  
12 |  And the partition <i>wall</i> in  front of the remaining space, toward the west, was seventy cubits in breadth;  the breadth of the partition wall was five cubits round about, and the length of  it ninety cubits.   
13 |  And he measured  in front of the house a length of a hundred cubits, and the remaining spaces and  the partitions; and the walls thereof were in length a hundred cubits.    
14 |  And the breadth in front of the house,  and the remaining <i>spaces</i> before <i>it were</i> a hundred cubits.     
15 |  And he measured the length of the  partition in front of the space left by the back parts of that house; and the <i> spaces</i> left on this side and on that side were in length a hundred cubits:  and the temple and the corners and the outer porch were ceiled.    
16 |  And the windows were latticed, <i>giving</i>  light round about to the three <i>stories</i>, so as to look through: and the  house and the parts adjoining were planked round about, and <i>so was</i> the  floor, and from the floor up to the windows, and the window <i>shutters</i>  folded back in three parts for one to look through.   
17 |  And almost all the way to the inner, and close to the  outer <i>side</i>, and upon all the wall round about within and without,    
18 |  were carved cherubs and palm-trees  between the cherubs, <i>and each</i> cherub <i>had</i> two faces.    
19 |  The face of a man was toward one  palm-tree on this side and on that side, and the face of a lion toward another  palm-tree on this side and on that side: the house was carved all round.    
20 |  From the floor to the ceiling were  cherubs and palm-trees carved.    
21 |  And the holy place and the temple  opened on four sides; in front of the holy places the appearance was as the look  of   
22 |  a wooden altar, the height of  it three cubits, and the length two cubits, and the breadth two cubits; and it  had horns, and the base of it and the sides of it were of wood: and he said to  me, This is the table, which is before the face of the Lord.    
23 |  And the temple <i>had</i> two doors,  and the sanctuary <i>had</i> two doors, with two turning leaves <i>apiece</i>;   
24 |  two leaves to the one, and two  leaves to the other door.   
25 |  And <i> there was</i> carved work upon them, and cherubs on the doors of the temple, and  palm-trees according to the carving of the sanctuary; and <i>there were</i>  stout planks in front of the porch without.    
26 |  And <i>there were</i> secret windows;  and he measured from side to side, to the roofing of the porch; and the sides of  the house were closely planked.   Chapter  42     

#42
1 |  And he brought me into the inner  court eastward, opposite the northern gate: and he brought me in, and behold  five chambers near the vacant space, and near the northern partition,    
2 |  a hundred cubits in length toward the  north, and in breadth fifty,   
3 |   ornamented accordingly as the gates of the inner court, and arranged accordingly  as the peristyles of the outer court, <i>with</i> triple porticos fronting one  another.   
4 |  And in front of the  chambers was a walk ten cubits in breadth, the length <i>reaching</i> to a  hundred cubits; and their doors were northward.   
5 |   And the upper walks were in like manner: for the peristyle  projected from it, <i>even</i> from the range of columns below, and <i>there was</i>  a space between; so <i>were there</i> a peristyle and a space between, and so <i> were there</i> two porticos.   
6 |  For  they were triple, and they had not pillars like the pillars of the outer ones:  therefore they projected from the lower ones and the middle ones from the  ground.    
7 |  And <i>there was</i> light without,  corresponding to the chambers of the outer court looking toward the front of the  northern chambers; the length <i>of them was</i> fifty cubits.    
8 |  For the length of the chambers looking  toward the inner court was fifty cubits, and these are the ones that front the  others; the whole was a hundred cubits.    
9 |  And <i>there were</i> doors of these  chambers for an outlet toward the east, so that one should go through them out  of the outer court,   
10 |  by the  opening of the walk at the corner; and the south parts were toward the south,  toward the remaining space, and toward the partition, and <i>so were</i> the  chambers.   
11 |  And the walk was in  front of them, according to the measures of the chambers toward the north, both  according to the length of them, and according to the breadth of them, and  according to all their openings, an according to all their turnings, and  according to their lights, and according to their doors.   
 12 |  <i>So were the measures</i> of the chambers toward the  south, and according to the doors at the entrance of the walk, as it were the  distance of a reed for light, and eastward as one went in by them.    
13 |  And he said to me, The chambers  toward the north, and the chambers toward the south, in front of the void  spaces, these are the chambers of the sanctuary, wherein the priests the sons of  Sadduc, who draw night to the Lord, shall eat the most holy things: and there  shall they lay the most holy things, and the meat-offering, and the  sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings; because the place is holy.    
14 |  None shall go in thither except the  priests, <i>and</i> they shall not go forth of the holy place into the outer  court, that they that draw nigh <i>to me</i> may be continually holy, and may  not touch their garments in which they minister, <i>with defilement</i>, for  they are holy; and they shall put on other garments whenever they come in  contact with the people.  
15 |  So the measurement of the house  within was accomplished: and he brought me forth by the way of the gate that  looks eastward, and measured the plan of the house round about in order.     
16 |  And he stood behind the gate looking  eastward, and measured five hundred <i>cubits</i> with the measuring reed.   
17 |  And he turned to the north and  measured in front of the north <i>side</i> five hundred cubits with the  measuring reed.   
18 |  And he turned to  the west, and measured in front of the west side, five hundred <i>cubits</i>  with the measuring reed.   
19 |  And he  turned to the south, and measured in front of the south side, five hundred <i> cubits</i> by the measuring reed.   
20 |   The <i>four sides he measured</i> by the same reed, and he marked  out the house and the circumference of the parts round about, <i>a space</i> of  five hundred <i>cubits</i> eastward, and a breadth of five hundred cubits, to  make a division between the sanctuary and the outer wall, that <i>belonged to</i>  the design of the house.   Chapter  43

1 |  Moreover he brought me to the gate  looking eastward, and led me forth.   
2 |   And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came by the eastern  way; and <i>there was</i> a voice of an army, as the sound of many redoubling <i> their shouts</i>, and the earth shone like light from the glory round about.   
3 |  And the vision which I saw was  like the vision which I saw when I went in to anoint the city: and the vision of  the chariot which I saw was like the vision which I saw at the river Chobar; and  I fell upon my face.    
4 |  And the glory of the Lord came into  the house, by the way of the gate looking eastward.   
5 |  And the Spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner  court; and, behold, the house of the Lord was full of glory.    
6 |  And I stood, and behold <i>there was</i>  a voice out of the house of one speaking to me, and a man stood near me,    
7 |  and he said to me,    Son of man, thou hast seen the place of my throne, and the  place of the soles of my feet, in which my name shall dwell in the midst of the  house of Israel for ever; and the house of Israel shall no more profane my holy  name, they and their princes, by their fornication, or by the murders of <i> their</i> princes in the midst of them;   
8 |   when they set my door-way by their door-way, and my thresholds  near to their thresholds: and they made my wall as it were joining myself and  them, and they profaned my holy name with their iniquities which they wrought:  and I destroyed them in my wrath and with slaughter.   
9 |  And now let them put away from me their fornication, and  the murders of their princes, and I will dwell in the midst of them forever.    
10 |  And thou, son of man, shew the house  to the house of Israel, that they may cease from their sins; and <i>shew</i> its  aspect and the arrangement of it.   
11 |   And they shall bear their punishment for all the things that they  have done: and thou shalt describe the house, and its entrances, and the plan  thereof, and all its ordinances, and thou shalt make known to them all the  regulations of it, and describe <i>them</i> before them: and they shall keep all  my commandments, and all my ordinances, and do them.    
12 |  And thou shalt shew the plan of the  house on the top of the mountain: all its limits round about <i>shall be</i>  most holy.  
13 |  And these are the measures of the  altar by the cubit of a cubit and a span, the cavity <i>shall be</i> a cubit  deep, and a cubit shall be the breadth, and the border on the rim of it round  about shall be a span: and this <i>shall be</i> the height of the altar    
14 |  from the bottom at the commencement of  the hollow part to this great mercy-seat, from beneath was two cubits, and the  breadth was a cubit; and from the little mercy-seat to the great mercy-seat,  four cubits, and the breadth was a cubit.   
15 |   And the altar <i>shall be</i> four cubits; and from the altar and  above the horns a cubit.   
16 |  And the  altar <i>shall be</i> of the length of twelve cubits, by twelve cubits <i>in  breadth</i>, square upon its four sides.    
17 |  And the mercy-seat <i>shall be</i>  fourteen cubits in length, by fourteen cubits in breadth on its four sides; and <i>there shall be</i> a border to it carried round about it of half a cubit; and  the rim of it <i>shall be</i> a cubit round about; and the steps thereof looking  eastward.    
18 |  And he said to me, Son of man, thus  saith the Lord God of Israel; These are the ordinances of the altar in the day  of its being made, to offer upon it whole-burnt-offerings, and to pour blood  upon it.   
19 |  And thou shalt appoint  to the priests the Levites of the seed of Sadduc, that draw nigh to me, saith  the Lord God, to minister to me, a calf of the herd for a sin-offering.    
20 |  And they shall take of its blood, and  shall put <i>it</i> on the four horns of the altar, and upon the four corners of  the propitiatory, and upon the base round about, and they shall make atonement  for it.   
21 |  And they shall take the  calf of the sin-offering, and it shall be consumed by fire in the separate place  of the house, outside the sanctuary.   
22 |   And on the second day they shall take two kids of the goats  without blemish for a sin-offering; and they shall make atonement for the altar,  as they made atonement with the calf.   
23 |   And after they have finished the atonement, they shall bring an  unblemished calf of the herd, and an unblemished ram of the flock.    
24 |  And ye shall offer <i>them</i> before  the Lord, and the priests shall sprinkle salt upon them, and shall offer them up <i>as</i> whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord.    
25 |  Seven days shalt thou offer a kid  daily for a sin-offering, and a calf of the herd, and a ram out of the flock:  they shall sacrifice them unblemished for seven days:   
26 |  and they shall make atonement for the altar, and shall  purge it; and they shall consecrate themselves.   
27 |   And it shall come to pass from the eighth day and onward, <i>that</i>  the priests shall offer your whole-burnt-offerings on the altar, and your  peace-offerings; and I will accept you, saith the Lord.   Chapter  44

1 |  Then he brought me back by the way  of the outer gate of the sanctuary that looks eastward; and it was shut.    
2 |  And the Lord said to me, This gate shall  be shut, it shall not be opened, and no one shall pass through it; for the Lord  God of Israel shall enter by it, and it shall be shut.   
3 |  For the prince, he shall sit in it, to eat bread before  the Lord; he shall go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and shall go forth  by the way of the same.  
4 |  And he brought me in by the way of the  gate that looks northward, in front of the house: and I looked, and, behold, the  house was full of the glory of the Lord: and I fell upon my face.    
5 |  And the Lord said to me, Son of man,  attend with thine heart, and see with <i>thine</i> eyes, and hear with thine  ears all that I say to thee, according to all the ordinances of the house of the  Lord, and all the regulations thereof; and thou shalt attend well to the  entrance of the house, according to all its outlets, in all the holy things.   
6 |  And thou shalt say to the  provoking house, <i>even</i> to the house of Israel, Thus saith the Lord God;  Let it suffice you <i>to have committed</i> all your iniquities, O house of  Israel!   
7 |  that ye have brought in  aliens, uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in my  sanctuary, and to profane it, when ye offered bread, flesh, and blood; and ye  transgressed my covenant by all your iniquities;   
8 |   and ye appointed <i>others</i> to keep the charges in my  sanctuary.    
9 |  Therefore thus saith the Lord God; No  alien, uncircumcised in heart or uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my  sanctuary, of all the children of strangers that are in the midst of the house  of Israel.  
10 |  But as for the Levites who departed  far from me when Israel went astray from me after their imaginations, they shall  even bear their iniquity.   
11 |  yet  they shall minister in my sanctuary, <i>being</i> porters at the gates of the  house, and serving the house: they shall slay the victims and the  whole-burnt-offerings for the people, and they shall stand before the people to  minister to them.   
12 |  Because they  ministered to them before their idols, and it became to the house of Israel a  punishment of iniquity; therefore have I lifted up my hand against them, saith  the Lord God.   
13 |  And they shall not  draw nigh to me to minister to me in the priests’ office, nor to approach the  holy things of the children of Israel, nor <i>to approach</i> my holy of holies:  but they shall bear their reproach for the error wherein they erred.    
14 |  They shall bring them to keep the  charges of the house, for all the service of it, and for all that they shall do.    
15 |  The priests the Levites, the sons of  Sadduc, who kept the charges of my sanctuary when the house of Israel went  astray from me, these shall draw night to me to minister to me, and shall stand  before my face, to offer sacrifice to me, the fat and the blood, saith the Lord  God.   
16 |  These shall enter into my  sanctuary, and these shall approach my table, to minister to me, and they shall  keep my charges.  
17 |  And it shall come to pass when they  enter the gates of the inner court, <i>that</i> they shall put on linen robes;  and they shall not put on woollen garments when they minister at the gate of the  inner court.   
18 |  And they shall have  linen mitres upon their heads, and shall have linen drawers upon their loins;  and they shall not tightly gird themselves.   
19 |   And when they go out into the outer court to the people, they  shall put off their robes, in which they minister; and they shall lay them up in  the chambers of the sanctuary, and shall put on other robes, and they shall not  sanctify the people with their robes.   
20 |   And they shall not shave their heads, nor shall they pluck off  their hair; they shall carefully cover their heads.   
21 |  And no priest shall drink any wine, when they go into the  inner court.   
22 |  Neither shall they  take to themselves to wife a widow, or one that is put away, but a virgin of the  seed of Israel: but if there should happen to be a priest’s widow, they shall  take <i>her</i>.    
23 |  And they shall teach my people <i>to  distinguish</i> between holy and profane, and they shall make known to them <i> the difference</i> between unclean and clean.   
24 |   And these shall attend at a judgment of blood to decide it: they  shall rightly observe my ordinances, and judge my judgments, and keep my  statutes and my commandments in all my feasts; and they shall hallow my  sabbaths.    
25 |  And they shall not go in to the dead  body of a man to defile themselves: only <i>a priest</i> may defile himself for  a father, or for a mother, or for a son, or for a daughter, or for a brother, or  for his sister, who has not been married.   
26 |   And after he has been cleansed, let him number to himself seven  days.   
27 |  And on whatsoever day they  shall enter into the inner court to minister in the holy place, they shall bring  a propitiation, saith the Lord God.    
28 |  And it shall be to them for an  inheritance: I am their inheritance: and no possession shall be given them among  the children of Israel; for I am their possession.   
29 |  And these shall eat the meat-offerings, and the  sin-offerings, and the trespass-offerings; and every special offering in Israel  shall be theirs.   
30 |  <i>And</i> the  first-fruits of all things, and the first-born of all <i>animals</i> and all  offerings, of all your first-fruits there shall be <i>a share</i> for the  priests; and ye shall give your earliest produce to the priest, to bring your  blessings upon your houses.   
31 |  And  the priests shall eat no bird or beast that dies of itself, or is taken of wild  beasts.   Chapter  45     

#45
1 |  And when ye measure the land for  inheritance, ye shall set apart first-fruits to the Lord, a holy space of the  land, in length twenty and five thousand <i>reeds</i>, and in breadth twenty  thousand; it shall be holy in all the borders thereof round about.    
2 |  And there shall be a sanctuary out of  this, five hundred <i>reeds in length</i> by five hundred in breadth, a square  round about; and <i>there shall be</i> a vacant space <i>beyond</i> this of  fifty cubits round about.   
3 |  And out  of this measurement shalt thou measure the length five and twenty thousand, and  the breadth twenty thousand: and in it shall be the holy of holies.    
4 |  Of the land shall be <i>a portion</i> for  the priests that minister in the holy place, and it shall be for them that draw  nigh to minister to the Lord: and it shall be to them a place for houses set  apart for their sacred office;   
5 |  the  length <i>shall be</i> twenty-five thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand:  and the Levites that attend the house, they shall have cities to dwell in for a  possession.    
6 |  And ye shall appoint <i>for</i> the  possession of the city five thousand in breadth, and in length twenty-five  thousand: after the manner of the first-fruits of the holy portion, they shall  be for all the house of Israel.    
7 |  And the prince <i>shall have a portion</i>  out of this, and out of this <i>there shall be a portion</i> for the  first-fruits of the sanctuary, <i>and</i> for the possession of the city, in  front of the first-fruits of the sanctuary, and in front of the possession of  the city westward, and from the western parts eastward: and the length <i>shall  be</i> equal to one of the parts of the western borders, and the length <i>shall  be</i> to the eastern borders of the land.   
8 |   And he shall have it for a possession in Israel: and the princes  of Israel shall no more oppress my people; but the house of Israel shall inherit  the land according to their tribes.  
9 |  Thus saith the Lord God; Let it  suffice you, ye princes of Israel: remove injustice and misery, execute judgment  and justice; take away oppression from my people, saith the Lord God.    
10 |  Ye shall have a just balance, and a just  measure, and a just choenix for measure.   
11 |   And in like manner there shall be one choenix as a measure of  capacity; the tenth of the gomor <i>shall be</i> the choenix, and the tenth of  the gomor shall be in fair proportion to the gomor.   
12 |  And the weights <i>shall be</i> twenty oboli, your pound  shall be five shekels, fifteen shekels and fifty shekels.  
13 |  And these are the first-fruits which  ye shall offer; a sixth part of a gomor of wheat, and the sixth part of it <i> shall consist</i> of an ephah of a core of barley.   
14 |  And <i>ye shall give as</i> the appointed measure of oil  one bath of oil out of ten baths; for ten baths are a gomor.    
15 |  And one sheep from the flock out of ten,  as an oblation from all the tribes of Israel, for sacrifices, and for  whole-burnt-offerings, and for peace-offerings, to make atonement for you, saith  the Lord God.   
16 |  And all the people  shall give these first-fruits to the prince of Israel.    
17 |  And through the prince shall be <i> offered</i> the whole-burnt-offerings and the meat-offerings, and the  drink-offerings in the feasts, and at the new moons, and on the sabbaths; and in  all the feasts of the house of Israel: he shall offer the sin-offerings, and the  meat-offering, and the whole-burnt-offerings, and the peace-offerings, to make  atonement for the house of Israel.    
18 |  Thus saith the Lord God; In the first  month, on the first <i>day</i> of the month, ye shall take a calf without  blemish out of the herd, to make atonement for the holy place.    
19 |  And the priest shall take of the blood  of the atonement, and put it on the thresholds of the house, and upon the four  corners of the temple, and upon the altar, and upon the thresholds of the gate  of the inner court.   
20 |  And thus  shalt thou do in the seventh month; on the first <i>day</i> of the month thou  shalt take a rate from each one; and ye shall make atonement for the house.    
21 |  And in the first <i>month</i>, on the  fourteenth <i>day</i> of the month, ye shall have the feast of the passover;  seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread.   
22 |   And the prince shall offer in that day a calf for a sin-offering  for himself, and the house, and for all the people of the land.    
23 |  And for the seven days of the feast he  shall offer as whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord seven calves and seven rams  without blemish daily for the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a  sin-offering, and a meat-offering.   
24 |   And thou shalt prepare a cake for the calf, and cakes for the  ram, and a hin of oil for the cake.   
25 |   And in the seventh month, on the fifteenth <i>day</i> of the  month, thou shalt sacrifice in the feast in the same way seven days, as <i>they  sacrificed</i> the sin-offerings, and the whole-burnt-offerings, and the  freewill-offering, and the oil.   Chapter  46   

#46
1 |  Thus saith the Lord God; The gate  that is in the inner court, that looks eastward, shall be shut the six working  days; <i>but</i> let it be opened on the sabbath-day, and it shall be opened on  the day of the new moon.   
2 |  And the  prince shall enter by the way of the porch of the inner gate, and shall stand at  the entrance of the gate, and the priests shall prepare his  whole-burnt-offerings and his peace-offerings, and he shall worship at the  entrance of the gate: then shall he come forth; but the gate shall not be shut  till evening.   
3 |  And the people of  the land shall worship at the entrance of that gate, both on the sabbaths and at  the new moons, before the Lord.    
4 |  And the prince shall offer  whole-burnt-offerings to the Lord on the sabbath-day, six lambs without blemish,  and a ram without blemish;   
5 |  and a  freewill-offering, a meat-offering for the ram, and a meat-offering for the  lambs, the gift of his hand, and a hin of oil for the meat-offering.    
6 |  And on the day of the new moon a calf  without blemish, and six lambs, and there shall be a ram without blemish;    
7 |  and a meat-offering for the ram, and  there shall be a meat-offering for the calf as a freewill-offering, and for the  lambs, according as his hand can furnish, and <i>there shall be</i> a hin of oil  for the cake.    
8 |  And when the prince goes in, he shall  go in by the way of the porch of the gate, and he shall go forth by the way of  the gate.   
9 |  And whenever the people  of the land shall go in before the Lord at the feasts, he that goes in by the  way of the north gate to worship shall go forth by the way of the south gate;  and he that goes in by the way of the south gate shall go forth by the way of  the north gate: he shall not return by the gate by which he entered, but he  shall go forth opposite it.   
10 |  And  the prince shall enter with them in the midst of them when they go in; and when  they go forth, he shall go forth.    
11 |  And in the feasts and in the general  assemblies the freewill oblation shall be a meat-offering for the calf, and a  meat-offering for the ram, and for the lambs, as his hand can furnish, and a hin  of oil for the meat-offering.   
12 |  And  if the prince should prepare <i>as</i> a thanksgiving a  whole-burnt-peace-offering to the Lord, and should open for himself the gate  looking eastward, and offer his whole-burnt-offering, and his peace-offerings,  as he does on the sabbath-day; then shall he go out, and shall shut the doors  after he has gone out.    
13 |  And he shall prepare daily as a  whole-burnt-offering to the Lord a lamb of a year old without blemish: in the  morning shall he prepare it.   
14 |  And  he shall prepare a freewill-offering for it in the morning, the sixth part of a  measure <i>of flour</i>, and a third part of a hin of oil to mix <i>therewith</i>  the fine flour, <i>as</i> a freewill-offering to the Lord, a perpetual  ordinance.   
15 |  Ye shall prepare the  lamb, and the freewill-offering, and the oil in the morning, <i>for</i> a  perpetual whole-burnt-sacrifice.  
16 |  Thus saith the Lord God; If the  prince shall give a gift to one of his sons out of his inheritance, this shall  be to his sons a possession <i>as</i> an inheritance.   
17 |  But if he give a gift to one of his servants, then it  shall belong to him until the year of release; and <i>then</i> he shall restore <i>it</i> to the prince: but of the inheritance of his sons <i>the possession</i>  shall continue to them.   
18 |  And the  prince shall by no means take of the inheritance of the people, to oppress them:  he shall give an inheritance to his sons out of his <i>own</i> possession: that  my people be not scattered, every one from his possession.  
19 |  And he brought me into the entrance  of the <i>place</i> behind the gate, into the chamber of the sanctuary belonging  to the priests, that looks toward the north: and, behold, there was a place set  apart.   
20 |  And he said to me, This is  the place where the priests shall boil the trespass-offerings and the  sin-offerings, and there shall they bake the meat-offering always; so as not to  carry <i>them</i> out into the outer court, to sanctify the people.    
21 |  And he brought me into the outer  court, and led me round upon the four sides of the court; and, behold, there was  a court on <i>each of</i> the sides of the court,   
22 |  on <i>every</i> side a court, <i>even</i> a court for all  the four <i>sides</i>, and <i>each</i> little court belonging to the court was  in length forty cubits, and <i>in</i> breadth thirty cubits, <i>there was</i>  one measure to the four.   
23 |  And <i> there were</i> chambers in them round about, round about the four, and  cooking-places formed under the chambers round about.   
24 |  And he said to me, These are the cooks’ houses, where they  that serve the house shall boil the sacrifices of the people.   Chapter  47     

#47
1 |  And he brought me to the entrance  of the house; and, behold, water issued from under the porch eastward, for the  front of the house looked eastward; and the water came down from the right side,  from the south to the altar.   
2 |  And  he brought me out by the way of the northern gate, and he led me round by the  way outside to the gate of the court that looks eastward; and, behold, water  came down from the right side,   
3 |  in <i>the direction</i> in which a man went forth opposite; and <i>there was</i> a  measuring line in his hand, and he measured a thousand <i>cubits</i> with the  measure;   
4 |  and he passed through the  water; <i>it was</i> water of a fountain: and <i>again</i> he measured a  thousand, and passed through the water; and the water was up to the thighs: and <i>again</i> he measured a thousand; and he passed through water up to the  loins.   
5 |  and <i>again</i> he  measured a thousand; and he could not pass through: for <i>the water</i> rose as  of a torrent which <i>men</i> cannot pass over.    
6 |  And he said to me, Hast thou seen <i> this</i>, son of man? Then he brought me, and led me back to the brink of the  river   
7 |  as I returned; and, behold,  on the brink of the river <i>there were</i> very many trees on this side and on  that side.   
8 |  And he said to me, This  is the water that goes forth to Galilee that lies eastward, and it is gone down  to Arabia, and has reached as far as to the sea to the outlet of the water: and  it shall heal the waters.   
9 |  And it  shall come to pass, <i>that</i> every animal of living <i>and</i> moving  creatures, all on which the river shall come, shall live: and there shall be  there very many fish; for this water shall go thither, and it shall heal <i>them</i>,  and they shall live: everything on which the river shall come shall live.     
10 |  And fishers shall stand there from  Ingadin to Enagallim; it shall be a place to spread out nets upon; it shall be  distinct; and the fishes thereof <i>shall be</i> as the fishes of the great sea,  a very great multitude.   
11 |  But at  the outlet of the water, and the turn of it, and where it overflows <i>its banks</i>,  they shall not heal at all; they are given to salt.   
12 |  And every fruit tree shall grow by the river, <i>even</i>  on the bank of it on this side and on that side: they shall not decay upon it,  neither shall their fruit fail: they shall bring forth the first-fruit of their  early crop, for these their waters come forth of the sanctuary: and their fruit  shall be for meat, and their foliage for health.  
13 |  Thus saith the Lord God; Ye shall  inherit these borders of the land; <i>they are</i> given by lot to the twelve  tribes of the children of Israel.   
14 |   And ye shall inherit it, each according to his brother’s portion, <i>even the land</i> concerning which I lifted up my hand to give <i>it</i> to  your fathers: and this land shall fall to you by lot.    
15 |  And these are the borders of the land  that lies northward, from the great sea that comes down, and divides the  entrance of Emaseldam;   
16 |  Maabthera,  Ebrameliam, between the coasts of Damascus and the coasts of Emathi, the  habitation of Saunan, which <i>places</i> are above the coasts of Auranitis.   
17 |  These are the borders from the  sea, from the habitations of Ænan, the coasts of Damascus, and the northern <i> coasts</i>.   
18 |  And the eastern  coasts between Loranitis, and Damascus, and the land of Galaad, and the land of  Israel, the Jordan divides to the sea that is east of the city of palm-trees.  These are the eastern <i>coasts</i>.   
19 |   And the southern and south-western <i>coasts are</i> from Thaeman  and the city of palm-trees, to the water of Marimoth Cadem, reaching forth to  the great sea. This part is the south and south-west.   
20 |  This part of the great sea forms a border, till <i>one  comes</i> opposite the entrance of Emath, <i>even</i> as far as the entrance  thereof. These are the parts west of Emath.    
21 |  So ye shall divide this land to them, <i>even</i> to the tribes of Israel.   
22 |   Ye shall cast the lot upon it, for yourselves and the strangers  that sojourn in the midst of you, who have begotten children in the midst of  you: and they shall be to you as natives among the children of Israel; they  shall eat with you in <i>their</i> inheritance in the midst of the tribes of  Israel.   
23 |  And they shall be in the  tribe of proselytes among the proselytes that are with them: there shall ye give  them an inheritance, saith the Lord God.   Chapter  48     

#48
1 |  And these are the names of the  tribes from the northern corner, on the side of the descent that draws a line to  the entrance of Emath the palace of Ælam, the border of Damascus northward on  the side of Emath the palace; and they shall have the eastern parts as far as  the sea, for Dan, one <i>portion</i>.   
2 |   And from the borders of Dan eastward as far as the west  sea-coast, for Asser, one.   
3 |  And  from the borders of Asser, from the eastern parts as far as the west coasts, for  Nephthalim, one.   
4 |  And from the  borders of Nephthalim, from the east as far as the west coasts, for Manasse,  one.   
5 |  And from the borders of  Manasse, from the eastern parts as far as the west coasts, for Ephraim, one.   
6 |  And from the borders of Ephraim,  from the eastern parts to the west coasts, for Ruben, one.    
7 |  And from the borders of Ruben, from the  eastern parts as far as the west coasts, for Juda, one.   
8 |  And from the borders of Juda, from the eastern parts shall  be the offering of first-fruits, in the breadth twenty-five thousand <i>reeds</i>,  and in length as one of the portions <i>measured</i> from the east even to the  western parts: and the sanctuary shall be in the midst of them.    
9 |  <i>As for</i> the first-fruits which they  shall offer to the Lord, <i>it shall be</i> in length twenty-five thousand, and  in breadth twenty-five thousand.   
10 |   Out of this shall be the first-fruits of the holy things to the priests,  northward, five and twenty-thousand, and towards the west, ten thousand, and  southward, five and twenty thousand: and the mountain of the sanctuary, shall be  in the midst of it,   
11 |  for the  priests, for the consecrated sons of Sadduc, who keep the charges of the house,  who erred not in the error of the children of Israel, as the Levites erred.   
12 |  And the first-fruits shall be  given to them out of the first-fruits of the land, <i>even</i> a most holy  portion from the borders of the Levites.    
13 |  And the Levites <i>shall have</i> the <i>part</i>, next to the borders of the priests, in length twenty-five thousand,  and in breadth ten thousand: the whole length <i>shall be</i> five and twenty  thousand, and the breadth twenty thousand.   
14 |   No <i>part</i> of it shall be sold, nor measured <i>as for sale</i>,  neither shall the first-fruits of the land be taken away: for they are holy to  the Lord.    
15 |  But <i>concerning</i> the five  thousand that remain in the breadth in the five and twenty thousand, they shall  be a suburb to the city for dwelling, and for a space before it: and the city  shall be in the midst thereof.   
16 |   And these <i>shall be</i> its dimensions; from the northern side four thousand  and five hundred, and from the southern side four thousand and five hundred, and  from the eastern side four thousand and five hundred, and from the western side <i>they shall measure</i> four thousand five hundred.   
17 |  And there shall be a space to the city northward two  hundred and fifty, and southward two hundred and fifty, and eastward two hundred  and fifty, and westward two hundred and fifty.    
18 |  And the remainder of the length that  is next to the first-fruits of the holy <i>portion shall be</i> ten thousand  eastward, and ten thousand westward: and they shall be the first-fruits of the  sanctuary; and the fruits thereof shall be for bread to them that labour for the  city.   
19 |  And they that labour for  the city shall labour for it out of all the tribes of Israel.    
20 |  The whole offering <i>shall be</i> a  square of twenty-five thousand by twenty-five thousand: ye shall separate <i> again part</i> of it, the first-fruits of the sanctuary, from the possession of  the city.    
21 |  And the prince <i>shall have</i> the  remainder on this side and on that side from the first-fruits of the sanctuary,  and <i>there shall be</i> a possession of the city, for five and twenty thousand  cubits in length, to the eastern and western borders, for five and twenty  thousand to the western borders, next to the portions of the prince; and the  first-fruits of the holy things and the sanctuary of the house <i>shall be</i>  in the midst of it.   
22 |  And there  shall be <i>a portion taken</i> from the Levites, from the possession of the  city in the midst of the princes between the borders of Juda and the borders of  Benjamin, and it shall be <i>the portion</i> of the princes.    
23 |  And <i>as for</i> the rest of the  tribes, from the eastern parts as far as the western, Benjamin <i>shall have</i>  one <i>portion</i>.   
24 |  And from the  borders of Benjamin, from the eastern parts to the western, Symeon, one.    
25 |  And from the borders of Symeon, from the  eastern parts to the western, Issachar, one.   
26 |   And from the borders of Issachar, from the eastern parts to the  western, Zabulon, one.   
27 |  And from  the borders of Zabulon, from the east to the western parts, Gad, one.    
28 |  And from the borders of Gad, from the  eastern parts to the south-western parts; his coasts shall even be from Thaeman,  and the water of Barimoth Cades, for an inheritance, unto the great sea.    
29 |  This is the land, which ye shall divide  by lot to the tribes of Israel, and these are their portions, saith the Lord  God.    
30 |  And these are the goings out of the  city northward, four thousand and five hundred by measure.    
31 |  And the gates of the city <i>shall be</i>  after the names of the tribes of Israel: three gates northward; the gate of  Ruben, one, and the gate of Juda, one, and the gate of Levi, one.    
32 |  And eastward four thousand and five  hundred: and three gates; the gate of Joseph, one, and the gate of Benjamin,  one, and the gate of Dan, one.   
33 |   And southward, four thousand and five hundred by measure: and three gates; the  gate of Symeon, one, and the gate of Issachar, one, and the gate of Zabulon,  one.   
34 |  And westward, four thousand  and five hundred by measure: <i>and</i> three gates; the gate of Gad, one, and  the gate of Asser, one, and the gate of Nephthalim, one.
35 |  The circumference, eighteen thousand <i>measures</i>: and the name of the city, from the day that it shall be  finished, shall be the name thereof.
