1| In the second year of Darius the  king, in the sixth month, on the firs <i>day</i> of the month, the word of the  Lord came by the hand of the prophet Aggaeus, saying, Speak to Zorobabel the son  of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec, the high  priest, saying, 
2| Thus saith the  Lord Almighty, saying, This people say, The time is not come to build the house  of the Lord. 
3| And the word of the  Lord came by the hand of the prophet Aggaeus, saying,  
4| Is it time for you to dwell in your  ceiled houses, whereas our house is desolate?  
5| And now thus saith the Lord Almighty;  Consider your ways, I pray you. 
6| Ye  have sown much, but brought in little; ye have eaten, and are not satisfied; ye  have drunk, and are not satisfied with drink, ye have clothed yourselves, and  have not become warm thereby: and he that earns wages has gathered <i>them</i>  into a bag full of holes.  
7| Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Consider  your ways. 
8| Go up to the mountain,  and cut timber; build the house, and I will take pleasure in it, and be  glorified, saith the Lord. 
9| Ye  looked for much, and there came little; and it was brought into the house, and I  blew it away. Therefore thus saith the Lord Almighty, Because my house is  desolate, and ye run everyone into his own house; 
10| therefore shall the sky withhold dew, and the earth shall  keep back her produce. 
11| And I will  bring a sword upon the land, and upon the mountains, and upon the corn, and upon  the wine, and upon the oil, and all that the earth produces, and upon the men,  and upon the cattle, and upon all the labours of their hands.
12| And Zorobabel the son of Salathiel,  of the tribe of Juda, and Jesus the son of Josedec, the high priest, and all the  remnant of the people, hearkened to the voice of the Lord their God, and the  words of the prophet Aggaeus, according as the Lord their God had sent him to  them, and the people feared before the Lord. 
13|  And Aggaeus the Lordâ€™s messenger spoke among the messengers of  the Lord to the people, <i>saying</i>, I am with you, saith the Lord.   
14| And the Lord stirred up the spirit of  Zorobabel the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and the spirit of Jesus  the son of Josedec, the high priest, and the spirit of the remnant of all the  people; and they went in, and wrought in the house of the Lord Almighty their  God, 
15|  on the four and twentieth <i> day</i> of the sixth month, in the second year of Darius the king.  Chapter  2

1 2|  In the seventh month, on the  twenty-first <i>day</i> of the month, the Lord spoke by Aggaeus the prophet,  saying, 
3|  Speak now to Zorobabel the  son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, and to Jesus the son of Josedec, the  high priest, and to all the remnant of the people, saying,  
4|  Who <i>is there</i> of you that saw  this house in her former glory? and how do ye now look upon it, as it were  nothing before your eyes? 
5|  Yet now  be strong, O Zorobabel, saith the Lord; and strengthen thyself, O Jesus the high  priest, the son of Josedec; and let all the people of the land strengthen  themselves, saith the Lord, and work, for I am with you, saith the Lord  Almighty; 
6|  and my Spirit remains in  the midst of you; be of good courage.  
7|  For thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet  once I will shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry <i>land</i>; 
8|  and I will shake all nations, and  the choice <i>portions</i> of all the nations shall come: and I will fill this  house with glory, saith the Lord Almighty. 
9|   Mine is the silver, and mine the gold, saith the Lord Almighty.  
10|  For the glory of this house shall be  great, the latter more than the former, saith the Lord Almighty: and in this  place will I give peace, saith the Lord Almighty, even peace of soul for a  possession to every one that builds, to raise up this temple.  
11|  On the four and twentieth <i>day</i>  of the ninth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to  Aggaeus the prophet, saying, 
12|  Thus  saith the Lord Almighty; Inquire now of the priest <i>concerning</i> the law,  saying, 
13|  If a man should take holy  flesh in the skirt of his garment, and the skirt of his garment should touch  bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any meat, shall it be holy? And the  priests answered and said, No. 
14|   And Aggaeus said, If a defiled person who is unclean by reason of a dead body,  touch any of these, shall it be defiled? And the priests answered and said, It  shall be defiled. 
15|  And Aggaeus  answered and said, So is this people, and so is this nation before me, saith the  Lord; and so are all the works of their hands: and whosoever shall approach  them, shall be defiled [because of their early burdens: they shall be pained  because of their toils; and ye have hated him that reproved in the gates]. 
16|  And now consider, I pray you,  from this day and beforetime, before they laid a stone on a stone in the temple  of the Lord, what manner of men ye were. 
17|   When ye cast into the corn-bin twenty measures of barley, and there were <i>only</i>  ten measures of barley: and ye went to the vat to draw out fifty measures, and  there were <i>but</i> twenty. 
18|  I  smote you with barrenness, and with blasting, and all the works of your hands  with hail; yet ye returned not to me, saith the Lord.  
19|  Set your hearts now <i>to think</i>  from this day and upward, from the four and twentieth <i>day</i> of the ninth  month, even from the day when the foundation of the temple of the Lord was laid; 
20|  consider in your hearts, whether <i>this</i> shall be known on the corn-floor, and whether yet the vine, and the  fig-tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive-trees that bear no fruit <i>are  with you</i>: from this day will I bless <i>you</i>.
21|  And the word of the Lord came the  second time to Aggaeus the prophet, on the four and twentieth <i>day</i> of the  month, saying, 
22|  Speak to Zorobabel  the son of Salathiel, of the tribe of Juda, saying,  I shake the heaven, and the earth, and the sea, and the dry <i> land</i>; 
23|  and I will overthrow  the thrones of kings, and I will destroy the power of the kings of the nations;  and I will overthrow chariots and riders; and the horses and their riders shall  come down, every one by the sword striving against his brother.  
24|  In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, I  will take thee, O Zorobabel, the son of Salathiel, my servant, saith the Lord,  and will make thee as a seal: for I have chosen thee, saith the Lord Almighty.
