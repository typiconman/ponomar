This folder contains scripts that use the Perl API and are use for regression testing.

The output of regression tests is written to /Ponomar/regtests/

The following tests are available:
1. simple_lectionary.pl
	This script runs the calendar for one year (2013) and determines the sequential lessons at Liturgy without the Lucan Jump
		and without any transfers. It is used for checking if the XML data are sane.
	Output is written to simple_lectionary.txt
	Base specification is in simple_lectionary_baseline.txt

	If you make changes to XML files, you should run this script and then check
	diff simple_lectionary.txt simple_lectionary_baseline.txt
	Only the timestamp line of this file should be changing.

	NOTE THAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT ACTUALLY CREATE THE SEQUENTIAL LECTIONARY
	because some transfers are handled directly in CMDs on individual days (e.g., for SSBN and SBN)
	But it's a fairly close approximation.

2. paschalion.pl
	This script runs creates a paschalion table for 532 years (one great cycle) beginning with 2000.
	Output is written to paschalion.txt
	Base specification is in paschalion_baseline.txt

	The purpose of this script is to test if:
		* Unicode support is working normally
		* The API loads properly
		* Support for Julian dates and computations is sane
		* The Paschalion is implemented correctly
	NOTE THAT ALL DATES ARE ACCORDING TO THE JULIAN CALENDAR
