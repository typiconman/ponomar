## A REGRESSION SCRIPT USING THE PERL API
## THIS SCRIPT CONSTRUCTS A SIMPLE LECTIONARY WITH SEQUENTIAL LITURGY READINGS FOR EVERY DAY OF THE YEAR
## WITHOUT TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE LUCAN JUMP OR ANY OTHER TRANSFERS
## OUTPUT IS WRITTEN TO ../../regtests/simple_lectionary.txt
## 
## INSTRUCTIONS FOR REGRESSION TESTING: RUN THIS SCRIPT, THEN COMPARE
## /Ponomar/regtests/simple_lectionary.txt (the Script's output) with /Ponomar/regtests/simple_lectionary_baseline.txt
## IF THE TWO FILES ARE DIFFERENT (EXCEPT FOR THE TIMESTAMP LINE), YOU HAVE A REGRESSION
##
## YOU MUST ENSURE THAT THE REGRESSION WAS AN INTENDED CHANGE BEFORE COMITTING YOUR CODE TO SVN
