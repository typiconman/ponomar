DOCUMENTATION README

The files in this directory are used to generate the Ponomar API Documentation. The documentation is generated automatically by
processing the POD code in the Perl modules files.

Perl coders: please document your changes using valid Perl POD syntax:
http://perldoc.perl.org/perlpod.html

After making any changes to the Perl code, go to this directory, and run the generate.sh file:

$ ./generate

This generates the documentation. It is required that you have Perl and pdflatex installed for this process.

IF YOU USE MICROSOFT WINDOWS, this will not work. Ask someone who uses Linux to generate the documentation for you.
