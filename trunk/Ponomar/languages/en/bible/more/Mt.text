1| The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
2| Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat Judas and his brethren;
3| And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;
4| And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and Naasson begat Salmon;
5| And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth; and Obed begat Jesse;
6| And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat Solomon of her [that had been the wife] of Urias;
7| And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia begat Asa;
8| And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram begat Ozias;
9| And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz begat Ezekias;
10| And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon begat Josias;
11| And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time they were carried away to Babylon:
12| And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;
13| And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and Eliakim begat Azor;
14| And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat Eliud;
15| And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and Matthan begat Jacob;
16| And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ.
17| So all the generations from Abraham to David [are] fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon [are] fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon to Christ [are] fourteen generations.
18| Now the birth of Jesus Christ was in this manner: When his mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together, she was found with child by the Holy Spirit.
19| Then Joseph her husband, being a just [man], and not willing to make her a public example, purposed to put her away privately.
20| But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of David, fear not to take to thee Mary thy wife: for that which is conceived in her is by the Holy Spirit.
21| And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.
22| Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet, saying,
23| Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us.
24| Then Joseph, being raised from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord had bidden him, and took to him his wife:
25| And knew her not till she had brought forth her first-born son: and he called his name JESUS.

1| Now, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days
 of Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
 Jerusalem,
2| Saying, Where is he that is born king of the Jews? for we
 have seen his star in the east, and have come to worship him.
3| When Herod the king had heard [these things], he was
 troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.
4| And when he had assembled all the chief priests and scribes
 of the people, he inquired of them where Christ should be born.
5| And they said to him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is
 written by the prophet,
6| And thou Bethlehem, [in] the land of Judas, art not the
 least among the princes of Judas: for out of thee shall come a
 Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.
7| Then Herod, when he had privately called the wise men,
 inquired of them diligently what time the star appeared.
8| And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go, and search
 diligently for the young child; and when ye have found [him],
 bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.
9| When they had heard the king, they departed; and lo, the
 star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it
 came and stood over where the young child was.
10| When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
 joy.
11| And when they had come into the house, they saw the young
 child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshiped him:
 and when they had opened their treasures, they presented to him
 gifts; gold, and frankincense, and myrrh.
12| And being warned by God in a dream that they should not
 return to Herod, they departed into their own country another
 way.
13| And when they had departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
 appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
 young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou
 there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young
 child to destroy him.
14| When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
 night, and departed into Egypt:
15| And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
 fulfilled which was spoken from the Lord by the prophet,
 saying, Out of Egypt have I called my son.
16| Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked by the wise men,
 was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
 that were in Bethlehem, and in all its borders, from two years
 old and under, according to the time which he had diligently
 inquired of the wise men.
17| Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the
 prophet, saying,
18| In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping,
 and great mourning, Rachel weeping [for] her children, and
 would not be comforted, because they are not.
19| But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
 appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
20| Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and
 go into the land of Israel: for they are dead who sought the
 young child's life.
21| And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
 came into the land of Israel.
22| But when he heard that Archelaus reigned in Judea in the
 room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:
 notwithstanding, being warned by God in a dream, he turned
 aside into the parts of Galilee:
23| And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it
 might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall
 be called a Nazarene.
#3
1| In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
 wilderness of Judea,
2| And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
3| For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
 saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
 the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.
4| And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a
 leathern girdle about his loins; and his food was locusts and
 wild honey.
5| Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the
 region about Jordan,
6| And were baptized by him in Jordan, confessing their sins.
7| But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
 his baptism, he said to them, O generation of vipers, who hath
 warned you to flee from the wrath to come?
8| Bring forth therefore fruit meet for repentance:
9| And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham for
 [our] father: for I say to you, that God is able of these
 stones to raise up children to Abraham.
10| And now also the ax is laid to the root of the trees:
 therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is
 hewn down, and cast into the fire.
11| I indeed baptize you in water to repentance: but he that
 cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not worthy
 to bear: he shall baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire:
12| Whose fan [is] in his hand, and he will thoroughly cleanse
 his floor, and gather his wheat into the granary; but he will
 burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.
13| Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan to John, to be
 baptized by him.
14| But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized by
 thee, and comest thou to me?
15| And Jesus answering said to him, Suffer [it to be so] now:
 for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he
 suffered him.
16| And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up immediately out of
 the water: and lo, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw
 the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting upon
 him:
17| And lo, a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved
 Son, in whom I am well pleased.
#4
1| Then was Jesus led by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be
 tempted by the devil.
2| And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
 afterward hungry.
3| And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou art the
 son of God, command that these stones be made bread.
4| But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live
 by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
 mouth of God.
5| Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
 him on a pinnacle of the temple,
6| And saith to him, If thou art the Son of God, cast thyself
 down, for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
 concerning thee: and in [their] hands they shall uphold thee,
 lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.
7| Jesus said to him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
 the Lord thy God.
8| Again, the devil taketh him up upon an exceeding high
 mountain, and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world, and
 the glory of them,
9| And saith to him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
 wilt fall down and worship me.
10| Then saith Jesus to him, Get thee behind me, Satan: for it is written,
 Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou
 serve.
11| Then the devil leaveth him, and behold, angels came and
 ministered to him.
12| Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
 departed into Galilee.
13| And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which
 is upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and
 Nephthalim;
14| That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
 prophet, saying,
15| The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, [by] the
 way of the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles:
16| The people who sat in darkness, saw great light; and to
 them who sat in the region and shades of death, light hath
 arisen.
17| From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent:
 for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.
18| And walking by the sea of Galilee, he saw two brethren,
 Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into
 the sea: for they were fishers.
19| And he saith to them, Follow me, and I will make you
 fishers of men.
20| And they immediately left [their] nets, and followed him.
21| And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James
 [the son] of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a boat with
 Zebedee their father, mending their nets: and he called them.
22| And they immediately left the boat, and their father, and
 followed him.
23| And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
 synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
 healing all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease among
 the people.
24| And his fame spread throughout all Syria: and they brought
 to him all sick people that were taken with diverse diseases
 and torments, and those who were possessed with demons, and
 those who were lunatic, and those that had the palsy; and he
 healed them.
25| And there followed him great multitudes of people from
 Galilee, and [from] Decapolis, and [from] Jerusalem, and [from]
 Judea, and [from] beyond Jordan.
#5
1| And seeing the multitudes, he ascended a mountain: and when
 he was seated, his disciples came to him.
2| And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,
3| Blessed [are] the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom
 of heaven.
4| Blessed [are] they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
5| Blessed [are] the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.
6| Blessed [are] they who hunger and thirst for righteousness:
 for they shall be filled.
7| Blessed [are] the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
8| Blessed [are] the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
9| Blessed [are] the peace-makers: for they shall be called
 children of God.
10| Blessed [are] they who are persecuted for righteousness'
 sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
11| Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute
 [you], and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely,
 for my sake.
12| Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great [is] your reward
 in heaven: for so they persecuted the prophets who were before
 you.
13| Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt hath lost its
 savor, with what shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good for
 nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot by
 men.
14| Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill
 cannot be hid.
15| Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a close
 vessel, but on a candlestick: and it giveth light to all that
 are in the house.
16| Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
 good works, and glorify your Father who is in heaven.
17| Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the
 prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill.
18| For verily I say to you, Till heaven and earth shall pass
 away, one jot or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law,
 till all be fulfilled.
19| Whoever therefore shall break one of these least
 commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the
 least in the kingdom of heaven: but whoever shall do, and teach
 [them], the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
 heaven.
20| For I say to you, That except your righteousness shall
 exceed [the righteousness] of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
 shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.
21| Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou
 shalt not kill; and whoever shall kill, shall be in danger of
 the judgment:
22| But I say to you, That whoever is angry with his brother
 without a cause, shall be in danger of the judgment: and
 whoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger of
 the council: but whoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be in
 danger of hell-fire.
23| Therefore if thou shalt bring thy gift to the altar, and
 there remember that thy brother hath aught against thee;
24| Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way;
 first be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
 gift.
25| Agree with thy adversary quickly, while thou art in the way
 with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
 judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be
 cast into prison.
26| Verily, I say to thee, thou shalt by no means come out
 thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.
27| Ye have heard that it was said to them of old time, Thou
 shalt not commit adultery:
28| But I say to you, That whoever looketh on a woman to lust
 after her, hath committed adultery with her already in his
 heart.
29| And if thy right eye shall cause thee to sin, pluck it out,
 and cast [it] from thee: for [it] is profitable for thee that
 one of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body
 should be cast into hell.
30| And if thy right hand shall cause thee to sin, cut it off,
 and cast [it] from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one
 of thy members should perish, and not [that] thy whole body
 should be cast into hell.
31| It hath been said, Whoever shall put away his wife, let him
 give her a writing of divorcement:
32| But I say to you, That whoever shall put away his wife,
 saving for the cause of lewdness, causeth her to commit
 adultery: and whoever shall marry her that is divorced,
 committeth adultery.
33| Again, ye have heard that it hath been said to them of old
 time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform to the
 Lord thy oaths:
34| But I say to you, Swear not at all: neither by heaven; for
 it is God's throne:
35| Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
 Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King,
36| Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst
 not make one hair white or black.
37| But let your communication be, Yea, yea, Nay, nay: for
 whatever [is] more than these cometh of evil.
38| Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye,
 and a tooth for a tooth.
39| But I say to you, That ye resist not evil: but whoever
 shall strike thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
 also.
40| And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
 coat, let him have [thy] cloke also.
41| And whoever shall constrain thee [to go] one mile, go with
 him two.
42| Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would
 borrow of thee, turn not thou away.
43| Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
 neighbor, and hate thy enemy:
44| But I say to you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
 you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them who
 despitefully use you, and persecute you;
45| That ye may be the children of your Father who [is] in
 heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the
 good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.
46| For if ye love them who love you, what reward have ye? do
 not even the publicans the same?
47| And if ye salute your friends only, what do ye more [than
 others]? do not even the publicans so?
48| Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in
 heaven is perfect.
#6
1| Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen by
 them: otherwise ye have no reward from your Father who is in
 heaven.
2| Therefore, when thou doest [thy] alms, do not sound a
 trumpet before thee, as the hypocrites do, in the synagogues,
 and in the streets, that they may have glory from men. Verily,
 I say to you, they have their reward.
3| But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what
 thy right hand doeth:
4| That thy alms may be in secret; and thy Father who seeth in
 secret, himself will reward thee openly.
5| And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
 [are]: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues, and in
 the corners of the streets, that they may be seen by men.
 Verily, I say to you, they have their reward.
6| But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
 thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father who is in secret,
 and thy Father who seeth in secret, will reward thee openly.
7| But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen
 do: for they think that they shall be heard for their much
 speaking.
8| Therefore be ye not like them: for your Father knoweth what
 things ye need before ye ask him.
9| After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father who art in
 heaven, Hallowed be thy name.
10| Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done on earth as [it is] in
 heaven.
11| Give us this day our daily bread.
12| And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.
13| And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil.
 For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for
 ever. Amen.
14| For, if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly
 Father will also forgive you:
15| But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will
 your Father forgive your trespasses.
16| Moreover, when ye fast, be not as the hypocrites, of a sad
 countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may
 appear to men to fast. Verily, I say to you, they have their
 reward.
17| But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thy head, and wash thy
 face;
18| That thou mayest not appear to men to fast, but to thy
 Father, who is in secret: and thy Father, who seeth in secret,
 shall reward thee [openly].
19| Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth
 and rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and
 steal:
20| But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where
 neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not
 break through nor steal.
21| For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.
22| The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thy eye be
 single, thy whole body will be full of light.
23| But if thy eye be evil, thy whole body will be full of
 darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee is darkness,
 how great [is] that darkness!
24| No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the
 one, and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
 despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.
25| Therefore I say to you, Be not anxious for your life, what
 ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
 what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than food, and the
 body than raiment?
26| Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do
 they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father
 feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?
27| Which of you by anxious care can add one cubit to his
 stature?
28| And why are ye anxious for raiment? Consider the lilies of
 the field how they grow? they toil not, neither do they spin?
29| And yet I say to you, that even Solomon in all his glory
 was not arrayed like one of these.
30| Wherefore, if God so clotheth the grass of the field, which
 to-day is, and to-morrow is cast into the oven, [will he] not
 much more [clothe] you, O ye of little faith?
31| Therefore be not anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or
 what shall we drink? or, with what shall we be clothed?
32| (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek) for your
 heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.
33| But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his
 righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.
34| Therefore be not anxious for the morrow: for the morrow
 will be solicitous for the things of itself. Sufficient to the
 day [is] its own evil.
#7
1| Judge not, that ye be not judged.
2| For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and the
 measure which ye give, shall be measured to you.
3| And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's
 eye, but considerest not the beam that is in thy own eye?
4| Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the
 mote out of thy eye; and behold, a beam [is] in thy own eye?
5| Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thy own eye;
 and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy
 brother's eye.
6| Give not that which [is] holy to dogs, neither cast ye your
 pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their feet,
 and turn again and rend you.
7| Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
 knock, and it shall be opened to you:
8| For every one that asketh, receiveth; and he that seeketh,
 findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened.
9| Or what man is there of you, who, if his son shall ask
 bread, will give him a stone?
10| Or if he shall ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?
11| If ye then being evil know [how] to give good gifts to your
 children, how much more shall your Father who is in heaven give
 good things to them that ask him?
12| Therefore all things whatever ye would that men should do
 to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
 prophets.
13| Enter ye in at the strait gate; for wide [is] the gate, and
 broad [is] the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there
 are who go in by it.
14| How strait [is] the gate, and narrow [is] the way,
 which leadeth to life, and few there are that find it.
15| Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's
 clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.
16| Ye shall know them by their fruits: Do men gather grapes
 from thorns, or figs from thistles:
17| Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a
 corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.
18| A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither [can] a
 corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.
19| Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
 and cast into the fire.
20| Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them,
21| Not every one that saith to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter
 into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my
 Father who is in heaven.
22| Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
 prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out demons?
 and in thy name done many wonderful works?
23| And then will I profess to them, I never knew you: depart
 from me, ye that work iniquity.
24| Therefore whoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
 them, I will liken him to a wise man, who built his house upon
 a rock:
25| And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
 blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was
 founded upon a rock.
26| And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
 them not, shall be likened to a foolish man, who built his
 house upon the sand:
27| And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
 blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell, and great was the
 fall of it.
28| And it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
 people were astonished at his doctrine.
29| For he taught them as [one] having authority, and not as
 the scribes.
#8
1| When he had come down from the mountain, great multitudes
 followed him.
2| And behold, there came a leper and worshiped him, saying,
 Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.
3| And Jesus put forth [his] hand, and touched him, saying, I
 will; be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.
4| And Jesus saith to him, See thou tell no man; but go, show
 thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses commanded,
 for a testimony to them.
5| And when he had entered into Capernaum, there came to him
 a centurion, beseeching him,
6| And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick with the
 palsy, grievously tormented.
7| And Jesus saith to him, I will come and heal him.
8| The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that
 thou shouldst come under my roof: but speak a word only, and
 my servant will be healed.
9| For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me:
 and I say to this [man], Go, and he goeth; and to another,
 Come, and he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth
 [it].
10| When Jesus heard [it], he marveled, and said to them that
 followed, Verily I say to you, I have not found so great faith,
 no, not in Israel.
11| And I say to you, that many shall come from the east and
 the west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob
 in the kingdom of heaven.
12| But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into
 utter darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
13| And Jesus said to the centurion, Depart; and as thou hast
 believed, so be it done to thee. And his servant was healed in
 the same hour.
14| And when Jesus had come into Peter's house, he saw his
 wife's mother laid, and sick with a fever.
15| And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she
 arose, and ministered to him.
16| When the evening was come, they brought to him many that
 were possessed with demons: and he cast out the spirits with
 [his] word, and healed all that were sick;
17| That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
 prophet, saying, He himself took our infirmities, and bore
 [our] sicknesses.
18| Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
 commandment to depart to the other side.
19| And a certain scribe came, and said to him, Master, I will
 follow thee whithersoever thou goest.
20| And Jesus saith to him, The foxes have holes, and the birds
 of the air [have] nests; but the Son of man hath not where to
 lay [his] head.
21| And another of his disciples said to him, Lord, suffer me
 first to go and bury my father.
22| But Jesus said to him, Follow me; and let the dead bury
 their dead.
23| And when he had entered into the boat, his disciples followed
 him.
24| And behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea,
 insomuch that the boat was covered with the waves: but he was
 asleep.
25| And his disciples came to [him], and awoke him, saying,
 Lord, save us: we perish.
26| And he saith to them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
 faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
 there was a great calm.
27| But the men marveled, saying, What manner of man is this,
 that even the winds and the sea obey him!
28| And when he had come to the other side, into the country of
 the Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with demons, coming
 out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass
 by that way.
29| And behold, they cried out, saying, What have we [to do]
 with thee, Jesus, [thou] Son of God? art thou come hither to
 torment us before the time?
30| And there was a good way off from them a herd of many
 swine, feeding.
31| So the demons besought him, saying, If thou expellest us,
 suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.
32| And he said to them, Go. And when they had come out, they
 went into the herd of swine: and behold, the whole herd of
 swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
 perished in the waters.
33| And they that kept them, fled, and went into the city, and
 told every thing; and what had befallen to the possessed with
 demons.
34| And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when
 they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of
 their borders.
#9
1| And he entered into a boat, and passed over, and came into
 his own city.
2| And behold, they brought to him a man sick with the palsy,
 lying on a bed: and Jesus, seeing their faith, said to the sick
 of the palsy, Son, be of good cheer; thy sins are forgiven
 thee.
3| And behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
 This [man] blasphemeth.
4| And Jesus, seeing their thoughts, said, Why think ye evil
 in your hearts?
5| For which is easier, to say, Thy sins are forgiven; or
 to say, Arise, and walk?
6| But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
 to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick with the palsy,)
 Arise, take up thy bed, and go to thy house.
7| And he arose, and departed to his house.
8| But when the multitude saw [it], they marveled, and
 glorified God, who had given such power to men.
9| And as Jesus was passing from thence, he saw a man named
 Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith to him,
 Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.
10| And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at table in the house,
 behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him
 and his disciples.
11| And when the Pharisees saw [it], they said to his
 disciples, Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?
12| But when Jesus heard [that], he said to them, They that are
 in health need not a physician, but they that are sick.
13| But go ye and learn what [that] meaneth, I will have mercy,
 and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
 sinners to repentance.
14| Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we
 and the Pharisees fast often, but thy disciples fast not?
15| And Jesus said to them, Can the children of the
 bride-chamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?
 but the days will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from
 them, and then they will fast.
16| No man putteth a piece of new cloth to an old garment: for
 that which is put in to fill it up, taketh from the garment,
 and the rent is made worse.
17| Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the
 bottles break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles
 perish: but they put new wine into new bottles, and both are
 preserved.
18| While he was speaking these things to them, behold, there
 came a certain ruler, and worshiped him, saying, My daughter is
 even now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she will
 live.
19| And Jesus arose, and followed him, and [so did] his
 disciples.
20| (And behold, a woman who was diseased with an issue of
 blood twelve years, came behind [him], and touched the hem of
 his garment.
21| For she said within herself, If I may but touch his
 garment, I shall be whole.
22| But Jesus turned himself about, and when he saw her, he
 said, Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee
 whole. And the woman was made whole from that hour.)
23| And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the
 minstrels and the people making a noise,
24| He said to them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
 sleepeth. And they derided him.
25| But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took
 her by the hand, and the maid arose.
26| And the fame of this went abroad into all that land.
27| And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
 crying, and saying, [Thou] son of David, have mercy on us.
28| And when he had come into the house, the blind men came to
 him: and Jesus saith to them, Believe ye that I am able to do
 this? They said to him, Yes, Lord.
29| Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your
 faith, be it to you.
30| And their eyes were opened; and Jesus strictly charged
 them, saying, See [that] no man know [it].
31| But they, when they had departed, spread abroad his fame in
 all that country.
32| As thy went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
 possessed with a demon.
33| And when the demon was cast out, the dumb spoke: and the
 multitudes marveled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.
34| But the Pharisees said, He casteth out demons, through the
 prince of the demons.
35| And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching
 in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom,
 and healing every sickness, and every disease among the people.
36| But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with
 compassion on them, because they fainted, and were scattered
 abroad, as sheep having no shepherd.
37| Then saith he to his disciples, The harvest truly [is]
 plentiful, but the laborers [are] few.
38| Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will
 send forth laborers into his harvest.
#10
1| And when he had called to [him] his twelve disciples, he
 gave them power [against] unclean spirits, to cast them out,
 and to heal all manner of sickness, and all manner of disease.
2| Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,
 Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James [the
 son] of Zebedee, and John his brother;
3| Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;
 James [the son] of Alpheus, and Lebbeus, whose surname was
 Thaddeus;
4| Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
 him.
5| These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying,
 Go not into the way of the Gentiles, and enter ye not into
 [any] city of the Samaritans.
6| But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
7| And as ye go, proclaim, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
 hand.
8| Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
 demons: freely ye have received, freely give.
9| Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses;
10| Nor bag for your journey, neither two coats, neither
 shoes, nor a staff: for the workman is worthy of his food.
11| And into whatever city or town ye shall enter, inquire who
 in it is worthy, and there abide till ye go thence.
12| And when ye come into a house, salute it, saying, Peace be to this house.
13| And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it:
 but if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.
14| And whoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words,
 when ye depart from that house, or city, shake off the dust of
 your feet.
15| Verily, I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for the
 land of Sodom and Gomorrah, in the day of judgment, than for
 that city.
16| Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves:
 be ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.
17| But beware of men: for they will deliver you to the
 councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues.
18| And ye will be brought before governors and kings for my
 sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.
19| But when they deliver you up, be not anxious how or what
 ye shall speak, for it shall be given to you in that same hour
 what ye shall speak.
20| For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
 which speaketh in you.
21| And the brother will deliver up the brother to death, and
 the father the child: and the children will rise up against
 [their] parents, and cause them to be put to death.
22| And ye will be hated by all [men] for my name's sake: but
 he that endureth to the end shall be saved.
23| But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
 another: for verily I say to you, Ye shall not have gone over
 the cities of Israel till the Son of man shall have come.
24| The disciple is not above [his] teacher, nor the servant
 above his lord.
25| It is enough for the disciple that he should be as his
 teacher, and the servant as his lord: if they have called the
 master of the house Beelzebub, how much more [will they call]
 them of his household?
26| Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered,
 that shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.
27| What I tell you in darkness, [that] speak ye in light: and
 what ye hear in the ear, [that] publish ye upon the house-tops.
28| And fear not them who kill the body, but are not able to
 kill the soul: but rather fear him who is able to destroy both
 soul and body in hell.
29| Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and not one of
 them shall fall on the ground without your Father.
30| But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
31| Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
 sparrows.
32| Whoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
 also confess before my Father who is in heaven.
33| But whoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
 before my Father who is in heaven.
34| Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came
 not to send peace, but a sword.
35| For I am come to set a man at variance against his father,
 and the daughter against her mother, and the daughter-in-law
 against her mother-in-law.
36| And a man's foes [will be] they of his own household.
37| He that loveth father or mother more than me, is not
 worthy of me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me,
 is not worthy of me.
38| And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth me, is not
 worthy of me.
39| He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth
 his life for my sake, shall find it.
40| He that receiveth you, receiveth me, and he that receiveth
 me, receiveth him that sent me.
41| He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet,
 shall receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a
 righteous man in the name of a righteous man, shall receive a
 righteous man's reward.
42| And whoever shall give to drink to one of these little
 ones, a cup of cold [water] only, in the name of a disciple,
 verily, I say to you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.
#11
1| And it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of
 commanding his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach
 and to preach in their cities.
2| Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ,
 he sent two of his disciples,
3| And said to him, Art thou he that should come, or do we
 look for another?
4| Jesus answered and said to them, Go and show John again
 those things which ye hear and see:
5| The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the
 lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised,
 and the poor have the gospel preached to them.
6| And blessed is [he] to whom I shall not be the cause of his
 falling into sin.
7| And as they departed, Jesus began to say to the multitudes
 concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see? a
 reed shaken with the wind?
8| But what went ye out to see? A man clothed in soft raiment?
 Behold, they that wear soft [clothing] are in kings' houses.
9| But what went ye out to see? A prophet? yes, I say to you,
 and more than a prophet.
10| For this is [he] concerning whom it is written, Behold, I
 send my messenger before thy face, who shall prepare thy way
 before thee.
11| Verily, I say to you, among them that are born of women,
 there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
 notwithstanding, he that is least in the kingdom of heaven, is
 greater than he.
12| And from the days of John the Baptist, until now, the
 kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it
 by force.
13| For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.
14| And if ye will receive [it], this is Elias who was to
 come.
15| He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.
16| But to what shall I liken this generation? It is like to
 children sitting in the markets, and calling to their fellows,
17| And saying, We have piped to you, and ye have not danced;
 We have mourned to you, and ye have not lamented.
18| For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say,
 He hath a demon.
19| The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say,
 Behold, a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of
 publicans and sinners. But wisdom is justified by her children.
20| Then he began to upbraid the cities in which most of his
 mighty works had been done, because they repented not.
21| Woe to thee, Chorazin; woe to thee, Bethsaida: for if the
 mighty works which have been done in you had been done in Tyre
 and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
 ashes.
22| But I say to you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
 Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.
23| And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted to heaven, shalt be
 brought down to Hades: for if the mighty works which have been
 done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained
 until this day.
24| But I say to you, that it shall be more tolerable for the
 land of Sodom, in the day of judgment, than for thee.
25| At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O
 Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these
 things from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them to
 babes.
26| Even so, Father, for so it seemed good in thy sight.
27| All things are delivered to me by my Father; and no man
 knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
 Father, save the Son, and [he] to whomsoever the Son will
 reveal [him].
28| Come to me, all [ye] that labor, and are heavy laden, and
 I will give you rest.
29| Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me: for I am meek
 and lowly in heart; and ye shall find rest to your souls.
30| For my yoke [is] easy, and my burden is light.
#12
1| At that time Jesus went on the sabbath through the corn,
 and his disciples were hungry, and began to pluck the ears of
 corn, and to eat.
2| But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Behold,
 thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do on the
 sabbath.
3| But he said to them, Have ye not read what David did when
 he was hungry, and they that were with him;
4| How he entered into the house of God, and ate the
 show-bread, which it was not lawful for him to eat, neither for
 them who were with him, but only for the priests?
5| Or have ye not read in the law, that on the sabbath the
 priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are blameless?
6| But I say to you, that in this place is [one] greater than
 the temple.
7| But if ye had known what [this] meaneth, I will have mercy,
 and not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.
8| For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath.
9| And when he had departed thence, he went into their
 synagogue.
10| And behold, there was a man who had [his] hand withered.
 And they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the
 sabbath? that they might accuse him.
11| And he said to them, What man shall there be among you,
 that shall have one sheep, and if it shall fall into a pit on
 the sabbath, will he not lay hold on it, and lift [it] out?
12| How much then is a man better than a sheep? wherefore it
 is lawful to do well on the sabbath days.
13| Then saith he to the man, Stretch out thy hand. And he
 stretched [it] out; and [it] was restored to a sound state like
 the other.
14| Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against
 him, how they might destroy him.
15| But when Jesus knew [it], he withdrew himself from thence:
 and great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all.
16| And charged them that they should not make him known:
17| That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
 prophet, saying,
18| Behold, my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in
 whom my soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him,
 and he shall show judgment to the Gentiles.
19| He shall not contend, nor cry; neither shall any man hear
 his voice in the streets.
20| A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall
 he not quench, till he shall send forth judgment to victory.
21| And [on] his name shall the Gentiles trust.
22| Then was brought to him one possessed with a demon, blind
 and dumb; and he healed him, so that the blind and dumb both
 spoke and saw.
23| And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the
 Christ, the son of David?
24| But when the Pharisees heard [it], they said, This [man]
 doth not cast out demons, but by Beelzebub the prince of the
 demons.
25| And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said to them, Every
 kingdom divided against itself, is brought to desolation; and
 every city or house divided against itself, shall not stand.
26| And if Satan casteth out Satan, he is divided against
 himself; how then shall his kingdom stand?
27| And if I by Beelzebub cast out demons, by whom do your
 children expel [them]? therefore they shall be your judges.
28| But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the
 kingdom of God is come to you.
29| Or else, how can one enter into a strong man's house, and
 seize his goods, except he shall first bind the strong man? and
 then he will plunder his house.
30| He that is not with me, is against me; and he that
 gathereth not with me, scattereth abroad.
31| Wherefore I say to you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
 shall be forgiven to men: but the blasphemy [against] the
 [Holy] Spirit shall not be forgiven to men.
32| And whoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it
 shall be forgiven him: but whoever speaketh against the Holy
 Spirit, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in the present world,
 neither in the [world] to come.
33| Either make the tree good, and its fruit good; or else
 make the tree corrupt, and its fruit corrupt: for the tree is
 known by [its] fruit.
34| O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
 things? for out of the abundance of the heart, the mouth
 speaketh.
35| A good man, out of the good treasure,
 bringeth forth good things: and an evil man, out of the evil
 treasure, bringeth forth evil things.
36| But I say to you, That for every idle word that men shall
 speak, they shall give account in the day of judgment.
37| For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
 thou shalt be condemned.
38| Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
 saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.
39| But he answered and said to them, An evil and adulterous
 generation seeketh for a sign, and there shall no sign be given
 to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas.
40| For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the
 whale's belly: so shall the Son of man be three days and three
 nights in the heart of the earth.
41| The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
 generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
 preaching of Jonas; and behold, a greater than Jonas [is] here.
42| The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with
 this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
 uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and
 behold, a greater than Solomon [is] here.
43| When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
 through dry places, seeking rest, and he findeth none.
44| Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I
 came out; and when he is come, he findeth [it] empty, swept,
 and garnished.
45| Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
 more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:
 and the last [state] of that man is worse than the first. Even
 so shall it be also to this wicked generation.
46| While he was yet speaking to the people, behold, [his]
 mother and his brethren stood without, desiring to speak with
 him.
47| Then one said to him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
 stand without, desiring to see thee.
48| But he answered and said to him that told him, Who is my
 mother? and who are my brethren?
49| And he stretched forth his hand towards his disciples, and
 said, Behold my mother and my brethren!
50| For whoever shall do the will of my Father who is in
 heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.
#13
1| The same day Jesus went out of the house, and sat by the
 sea side.
2| And great multitudes were gathered to him, so that he went
 into the boat, and sat down; and the whole multitude stood on the
 shore.
3| And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying,
 Behold, a sower went forth to sow;
4| And when he sowed, some [seeds] fell by the way side, and
 the fowls came and devoured them:
5| Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
 and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of
 earth:
6| And when the sun had risen, they were scorched; and because
 they had not root, they withered.
7| And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and
 choked them:
8| But others fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit,
 some a hundred-fold, some sixty-fold, some thirty-fold.
9| Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
10| And the disciples came, and said to him, Why speakest thou
 to them in parables?
11| He answered and said to them, Because it is given to you
 to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
 is not given.
12| For whoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
 more abundance: but whoever hath not, from him shall be taken
 away even that which he hath.
13| Therefore I speak to them in parables: because they seeing
 see not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand,
14| lest at any time they should be converted. And then unto them
	shall be fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which
 saith, By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and
 seeing ye shall see, and shall not perceive:
15| For this people's heart is become gross, and [their] ears
 are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at
 any time they should see with [their] eyes, and hear with
 [their] ears, and should understand with [their] heart, and
 should be converted, and I should heal them.
16| But blessed [are] your eyes, for they see: and your ears,
 for they hear.
17| For verily I say to you, That many prophets and righteous
 [men] have desired to see [the things] which ye see, and have
 not seen [them]; and to hear [the things] which ye hear, and
 have not heard [them].
18| Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.
19| When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
 understandeth [it] not, then cometh the wicked [one], and
 catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he who
 received seed by the way side.
20| But he that received the seed into stony places, the same
 is he that heareth the word, and immediately with joy receiveth
 it;
21| Yet he hath not root in himself, but endureth for a while:
 for when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the
 word, forthwith he is offended.
22| He also that received seed among the thorns is he that
 heareth the word; and the care of this world, and the
 deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and he becometh
 unfruitful.
23| But he that receiveth seed into the good ground is he that
 heareth the word, and understandeth [it]; who also beareth
 fruit, and bringeth forth, some a hundred fold, some sixty,
 some thirty.
24| Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom
 of heaven is likened to a man who sowed good seed in his field:
25| But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among
 the wheat, and departed.
26| But when the blade had sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
 then appeared the tares also.
27| So the servants of the householder came and said to him,
 Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? from whence
 then hath it tares?
28| He said to them, An enemy hath done this. The servants
 said to him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them?
29| But he said, No; lest while ye gather the tares, ye root
 up also the wheat with them.
30| Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time
 of harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye first the
 tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather the
 wheat into my barn.
31| Another parable he proposed to them, saying, The kingdom
 of heaven is like a grain of mustard-seed, which a man took,
 and sowed in his field:
32| Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is
 grown, it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so
 that the birds of the air come and lodge on its branches.
33| Another parable he spoke to them; The kingdom of heaven is
 like leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of
 meal, till the whole was leavened.
34| All these things Jesus spoke to the multitude in parables;
 and without a parable he spoke not to them:
35| That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the
 prophet, saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter
 things which have been kept secret from the foundation of the
 world.
36| Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the
 house: and his disciples came to him, saying, Declare to us the
 parable of the tares of the field.
37| He answered and said to them, He that soweth the good seed
 is the Son of man;
38| The field is the world; the good seed are the children of
 the kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked
 [one];
39| The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the
 end of the world; and the reapers are the angels.
40| As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the
 fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.
41| The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
 gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them who
 do iniquity;
42| And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
 wailing and gnashing of teeth.
43| Then shall the righteous shine as the sun in the kingdom
 of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.
44| Again, the kingdom of heaven is like treasure hid in a
 field; which, when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
 thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
 field.
45| Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant seeking
 goodly pearls:
46| Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and
 sold all that he had, and bought it.
47| Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net, that was cast
 into the sea, and gathered of every kind:
48| Which, when it was full, they drew to the shore, and sat
 down, and gathered the good into vessels, but cast away the
 bad.
49| So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall
 come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,
50| And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall
 be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
51| Jesus saith to them, Have ye understood all these things?
 They say to him, Yes, Lord.
52| Then said he to them, Therefore every scribe [who is]
 instructed to the kingdom of heaven, is like a man [that is] a
 householder, who bringeth forth out of his treasure [things]
 new and old.
53| And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these
 parables, he departed thence.
54| And when he had come into his own country, he taught them
 in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said,
 Whence hath this [man] this wisdom, and [these] mighty works?
55| Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called
 Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas?
56| And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then
 hath this [man] all these things?
57| And they were offended in him. But Jesus said to them, A
 prophet is not without honor, save in his own country, and in
 his own house.
58| And he did not many mighty works there, because of their
 unbelief.
#14
1| At that time Herod the Tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,
2| And said to his servants, This is John the Baptist; he hath
 risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do show forth
 themselves in him.
3| For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put
 [him] in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's
 wife.
4| For John had said to him, It is not lawful for thee to have
 her.
5| And when he would have put him to death, he feared the
 multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.
6| But when Herod's birth-day was kept, the daughter of
 Herodias danced before them, and pleased Herod.
7| Upon which he promised with an oath to give her whatever
 she would ask.
8| And she, being before instructed by her mother, said, Give
 me here the head of John the Baptist in a dish.
9| And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the sake of the
 oath, and of them who sat with him at table, he commanded [it]
 to be given [her].
10| And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.
11| And his head was brought in a dish, and given to the
 damsel: and she brought [it] to her mother.
12| And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried
 it, and went and told Jesus.
13| When Jesus heard [of it], he departed thence in a boat,
 into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard [of
 it], they followed him on foot out of the cities.
14| And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was
 moved with compassion towards them, and he healed their sick.
15| And when it was evening, his disciples came to him,
 saying, This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send
 the multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
 themselves victuals.
16| But Jesus said to them, They need not depart; give ye them
 to eat.
17| And they say to him, We have here but five loaves, and two
 fishes.
18| He said, Bring them hither to me.
19| And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass,
 and took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to
 heaven, he blessed, and broke, and gave the loaves to [his]
 disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.
20| And they all ate, and were satisfied: and they took up of
 the fragments that remained twelve baskets full.
21| And they that had eaten were about five thousand men,
 besides women and children.
22| And immediately Jesus constrained his disciples to get
 into the boat, and to go before him to the other side, while he
 sent the multitudes away.
23| And when he had sent the multitudes away, he ascended a
 mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was
 there alone.
24| But the boat was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
 waves: for the wind was contrary.
25| And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went to them,
 walking on the sea.
26| And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they
 were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for
 fear.
27| But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Be of good
 cheer; it is I; be not afraid.
28| And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it is thou, bid
 me come to thee on the water.
29| And he said, Come. And when Peter had come down out of the
 boat, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.
30| But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
 beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.
31| And immediately Jesus stretched forth [his] hand, and
 caught him, and said to him, O thou of little faith, Why didst
 thou doubt?
32| And when they had come into the boat, the wind ceased.
33| Then they that were in the boat came and worshiped him,
 saying, In truth thou art the son of God.
34| And when they had gone over, they came into the land of
 Gennesaret.
35| And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they
 sent out into all the surrounding country, and brought to him
 all that were diseased;
36| And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his
 garment: and as many as touched were restored to health.
#15
1| Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, who were of
 Jerusalem, saying,
2| Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the
 presbyters? for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.
3| But he answered and said to them, Why do ye also transgress
 the commandment of God by your tradition?
4| For God commanded, saying, Honor father and mother:
 and, He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.
5| But ye say, Whoever shall say to [his] father or [his]
 mother, [It is] a gift, by whatever thou mightest be profited
 by me; (6) And honor not his father or his mother, [he shall be free].
6| Thus have ye made the commandment of God of no effect by your
 tradition.
7| [Ye] hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,
8| This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, and honor me
 with [their] lips; but their heart is far from me.
9| But in vain they do worship me, teaching [for] doctrines
 the commandments of men.
10| And he called the multitude, and said to them, Hear, and
 understand:
11| Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but
 that which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.
12| Then came his disciples, and said to him, Knowest thou
 that the Pharisees were offended after they heard this saying?
13| But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly
 Father hath not planted, shall be extirpated.
14| Let them alone: they are blind leaders of the blind. And
 if the blind leadeth the blind, both will fall into the ditch.
15| Then answered Peter and said to him, Declare to us this
 parable.
16| And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?
17| Do ye not yet understand, that whatever entereth in at the
 mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?
18| But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
 from the heart; and they defile the man.
19| For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,
 adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:
20| These are [the things] which defile a man: but to eat with
 unwashen hands defileth not a man.
21| Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the territories
 of Tyre and Sidon.
22| And behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same
 territories, and cried to him, saying, Have mercy on me, O
 Lord, [thou] son of David; my daughter is grievously afflicted
 with a demon.
23| But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
 besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.
24| But he answered and said, I am not sent but to the lost
 sheep of the house of Israel.
25| Then came she and worshiped him, saying, Lord, help me.
26| But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
 children's bread, and to cast [it] to dogs.
27| And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crums
 which fall from their masters' table.
28| Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great [is]
 thy faith: be it to thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter
 was healed from that very hour.
29| And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh to the sea
 of Galilee; and ascended a mountain, and sat down there.
30| And great multitudes came to him, having with them [those
 that were] lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast
 them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:
31| So that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb to
 speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the blind
 to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.
32| Then Jesus called his disciples [to him], and said, I have
 compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
 three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them
 away fasting, lest they faint in the way.
33| And his disciples say to him, Whence should we have so
 much bread in the wilderness, as to satisfy so great a
 multitude?
34| And Jesus saith to them, How many loaves have ye? And they
 said, Seven, and a few little fishes.
35| And he commanded the multitude to sit on the ground.
36| And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave
 thanks, and broke [them], and gave to his disciples, and the
 disciples to the multitude.
37| And they all ate and were filled: and they took up of the
 fragments that were left seven baskets full.
38| And they that had eaten were four thousand men, besides
 women and children.
39| And he sent away the multitude, and went up into the boat,
 and came into the borders of Magdala.
#16
1| The Pharisees also and the Sadducees came, and, tempting,
 desired him that he would show them a sign from heaven.
2| He answered and said to them, When it is evening, ye say,
 [It will be] fair weather: for the sky is red.
3| And in the morning, [It will be] foul weather to-day: for
 the sky is red and lowering. O [ye] hypocrites, ye can discern
 the face of the sky; but can ye not [discern] the signs of the
 times?
4| A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh for a sign; and
 there shall no sign been to it, but the sign of the prophet
 Jonas. And he left them, and departed.
5| And when his disciples had come to the other side, they had
 forgotten to take bread.
6| Then Jesus said to them, Take heed and beware of the leaven
 of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.
7| And they reasoned among themselves, saying, [It is] because
 we have taken no bread.
8| [Which] when Jesus perceived, he said to them, O ye of
 little faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have
 brought no bread?
9| Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves
 of the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?
10| Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how
 many baskets ye took up?
11| How is it that ye do not understand that I spoke not to
 you concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of
 the Pharisees and of the Sadducees?
12| Then they understood that he did not caution them against
 the leaven of bread, but against the doctrine of the Pharisees
 and of the Sadducees.
13| When Jesus came into the borders of Cesarea Phillippi, he
 asked his disciples, saying, Who do men say that I the Son of
 man am?
14| And they said, Some [say that thou art] John the Baptist:
 some Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.
15| He saith to them, But who say ye that I am?
16| And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ,
 the Son of the living God.
17| And Jesus answered and said to him, Blessed art thou,
 Simon-Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed [it] to
 thee, but my Father who is in heaven.
18| And I say also to thee, that thou art Peter, and upon this
 rock I will build my church: and the gates of Hades shall not
 prevail against it.
19| And I will give to thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
 and whatever thou shalt bind on earth, shall be bound in
 heaven; and whatever thou shalt loose on earth, shall be loosed
 in heaven.
20| Then he charged his disciples that they should tell no man
 that he was Jesus the Christ.
21| From that time forth Jesus began to show to his disciples,
 that he must go to Jerusalem, and suffer many things from the
 presbyters and chief priests, and scribes, and be killed, and be
 raised again the third day.
22| Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be
 it far from thee, Lord: this shall not be to thee.
23| But he turned, and said to Peter, Get thee behind me,
 Satan; thou art an offense to me: for thou savorest not the
 things that are of God, but those that are of men.
24| Then said Jesus to his disciples, If any [man] will come
 after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and
 follow me.
25| For whoever will save his life, shall lose it: and whoever
 will lose his life for my sake, shall find it.
26| For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole
 world, and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in
 exchange for his soul?
27| For the Son of man will come in the glory of his Father,
 with his angels; and then he will reward every man according to
 his works.
28| Verily I say to you, There are some standing here, who
 shall not taste death, till they shall see the Son of man
 coming in his kingdom.
#17
1| And after six days, Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
 brother, and bringeth them upon a high mountain apart.
2| And [he] was transfigured before them: and his face shone
 as the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.
3| And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elias talking
 with him.
4| Then answered Peter, and said to Jesus, Lord, it is good
 for us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
 tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
 Elias.
5| While he was yet speaking, behold, a bright cloud
 overshadowed them: and behold, a voice out of the cloud, which
 said, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased: hear
 ye him.
6| And when the disciples heard [it], they fell on their face,
 and were in great fear.
7| And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be
 not afraid.
8| And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man,
 save Jesus only.
9| And as they were descending the mountain, Jesus charged
 them, saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man
 be raised again from the dead.
10| And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the
 scribes, that Elias must first come?
11| And Jesus answered and said to them, Elias truly will
 first come, and restore all things:
12| But I say to you, that Elias is come already, and they
 knew him not, but have done to him whatever they pleased:
 likewise will also the Son of man suffer by them.
13| Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them
 concerning John the Baptist.
14| And when they had come to the multitude, there came to him
 a [certain] man kneeling down to him, and saying,
15| Lord, have mercy on my son; for he is lunatic, and
 grievously distressed; for often he falleth into the fire, and
 often into the water.
16| And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not
 cure him.
17| Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
 generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I
 suffer you? bring him hither to me.
18| And Jesus rebuked the demon, and he departed out of him:
 and the child was cured from that very hour.
19| Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why
 could not we cast him out?
20| And Jesus said to them, Because of your unbelief: for
 verily I say to you, If ye have faith as a grain of
 mustard-seed, ye shall say to this mountain, Remove hence to
 yonder place, and it shall remove; and nothing shall be
 impossible to you.
21| However, this kind goeth not out, but by prayer and
 fasting.
22| And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The
 Son of man will be betrayed into the hands of men:
23| And they will kill him, and the third day he will be
 raised again: And they were exceedingly grieved.
24| And when they had come to Capernaum, they that received
 tribute-[money], came to Peter, and said, Doth not your Master
 pay tribute?
25| He saith, Yes. And when he had come into the house, Jesus
 anticipated him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? from whom
 do the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? from their
 own children, or from strangers?
26| Peter saith to him, From strangers. Jesus saith to him,
 Then are the children free.
27| Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to
 the sea, and cast a hook, and take the fish that first cometh
 up: and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a
 piece of money: take that, and give to them for me and thee.
#18
1| At the same time came the disciples to Jesus, saying, Who
 is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?
2| And Jesus called a little child to him, and set him in the
 midst of them,
3| And said, Verily I say to you, Except ye be converted, and
 become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
 of heaven.
4| Whoever therefore shall humble himself as this little
 child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.
5| And whoever shall receive one such little child in my name,
 receiveth me.
6| But whoever shall cause one of these little ones who
 believe in me, to sin, it were better for him that a millstone
 were hanged to his neck, and [that] he were drowned in the
 depth of the sea.
7| Woe to the world because of offenses! for it must needs be
 that offenses come; but woe to that man by whom the offense
 cometh!
8| Wherefore, if thy hand or thy foot causeth thee to sin, cut
 them off, and cast [them] from thee: it is better for thee to
 enter into life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or
 two feet, to be cast into everlasting fire.
9| And if thy eye causeth thee to sin, pluck it out, and cast
 [it] from thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with
 one eye, rather than having two eyes, to be cast into
 hell-fire.
10| Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones:
 for I say to you, that in heaven their angels do always behold
 the face of my Father who is in heaven.
11| For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.
12| How think ye? if a man hath a hundred sheep, and one of
 them is gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and
 go to the mountains, and seek that which is gone astray?
13| And if he findeth it, verily I say to you, he rejoiceth
 more over that [sheep], than over the ninety and nine which
 went not astray.
14| Even so it is not the will of your Father who is in
 heaven, that one of these little ones should perish.
15| Moreover, if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go
 and tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall
 hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.
16| But if he will not hear [thee], [then] take with thee one
 or two more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every
 word may be established.
17| And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell [it] to the
 church: but if he shall neglect to hear the church, let him be
 to thee as a heathen and a publican.
18| Verily I say to you, Whatever ye shall bind on earth,
 shall be bound in heaven: and whatever ye shall loose on earth,
 shall be loosed in heaven.
19| Again verily I say to you, That if two of you shall agree on
 earth, concerning any thing that they shall ask, it shall be
 done for them by my Father who is in heaven.
20| For where two or three are assembled in my name, there am
 I in the midst of them.
21| Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how often shall my
 brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?
22| Jesus saith to him, I say not to thee, Until seven times:
 but, Until seventy times seven.
23| Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened to a certain
 king who would take account of his servants.
24| And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought to him
 who owed him ten thousand talents.
25| But as he had not ability to pay, his lord commanded him
 to be sold, and his wife and children, and all that he had, and
 payment to be made.
26| The servant therefore fell down, and worshiped him,
 saying, Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.
27| Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion,
 and loosed him, and forgave him the debt.
28| But the same servant went out, and found one of his
 fellow-servants, who owed him a hundred pence: and he laid
 hands on him, and took [him] by the throat, saying, Pay me if
 anything thou owest.
29| And his fellow-servant fell down at his feet, and besought
 him, saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee.
30| And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till
 he should pay the debt.
31| So when his fellow-servants saw what was done, they were
 very sorry, and came and told to their lord all that was done.
32| Then his lord, having called him, said to him, O thou
 wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because thou
 desiredst me:
33| Shouldst thou not also have had compassion on thy
 fellow-servant, even as I had pity on thee?
34| And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the
 tormentors, till he should pay all that was due to him.
35| So likewise shall my heavenly Father do to you, if ye from
 your hearts forgive not every one his brother their trespasses.
#19
1| And it came to pass, [that] when Jesus had finished these
 sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the borders of
 Judea, beyond Jordan:
2| And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them
 there.
3| The Pharisees also came to him, tempting him, and saying to
 him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
 cause?
4| And he answered and said to them, Have ye not read, that he
 who made [them], at the beginning made them male and female,
5| And said, For this [cause] shall a man leave father and
 mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they two shall be one
 flesh?
6| Wherefore they are no more two, but one flesh. Therefore
 what God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.
7| They say to him, Why did Moses then command to give a
 writing of divorcement, and to put her away?
8| He saith to them, Moses, because of the hardness of your
 hearts, suffered you to put away your wives: but from the
 beginning it was not so.
9| And I say to you, Whoever shall put away his wife, except
 for lewdness, and shall marry another, committeth adultery: and
 whoever marrieth her who is put away, committeth adultery.
10| His disciples say to him, If the case of the man is so
 with [his] wife, it is not good to marry.
11| But he said to them, All [men] cannot receive this saying,
 save [they] to whom it is given.
12| For there are some eunuchs, who were so born from [their]
 mothers womb: and there are some eunuchs, who were made eunuchs
 by men: and there are eunuchs, who have made themselves eunuchs
 for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that is able to receive
 [it], let him receive [it].
13| Then were brought to him little children, that he should
 put [his] hands on them, and pray: and the disciples rebuked
 them.
14| But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them
 not to come to me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.
15| And he laid [his] hands on them, and departed thence.
16| And behold, one came and said to him, Good Master, what
 good thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?
17| And he said to him, Why callest thou me good? [there is]
 none good but one, [that is], God: but if thou wilt enter into
 life, keep the commandments.
18| He saith to him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no
 murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal,
 Thou shalt not bear false witness,
19| Honor father and mother: and, Thou shalt love
 thy neighbor as thyself.
20| The young man saith to him, All these things have I kept
 from my youth: what lack I yet?
21| Jesus said to him, If thou wilt be perfect, go [and] sell
 what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have
 treasure in heaven: and come [and] follow me.
22| But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
 sorrowful: for he had great possessions.
23| Then said Jesus to his disciples, Verily I say to you,
 that a rich man shall with difficulty enter into the kingdom of
 heaven.
24| And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go
 through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
 the kingdom of God.
25| When his disciples heard [it], they were exceedingly
 amazed, saying, Who then can be saved?
26| But Jesus beheld [them], and said to them, With men this
 is impossible, but with God all things are possible.
27| Then answered Peter, and said to him, Behold, we have
 forsaken all, and followed thee? what shall we have therefore?
28| And Jesus said to them, Verily I say to you, that ye who
 have followed me in the regeneration, when the Son of man shall
 sit on the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon twelve
 thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
29| And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
 sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands
 for my name's sake, shall receive a hundred-fold, and shall
 inherit everlasting life.
30| But many [that are] first shall be last, and the last
 [shall be] first.
#20
1| For the kingdom of heaven is like to a man [that is] a
 householder, who went out early in the morning to hire laborers
 into his vineyard.
2| And when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day,
 he sent them into his vineyard.
3| And he went out about the third hour, and saw others
 standing idle in the market-place,
4| And said to them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and
 whatever is right, I will give you. And they departed.
5| Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
 likewise.
6| And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
 standing idle, and saith to them, Why stand ye here all the day
 idle?
7| They say to him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith to
 them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatever is right,
 [that] shall ye receive.
8| So when evening was come, the lord of the vineyard saith to
 his steward, Call the laborers, and give them [their] hire,
 beginning from the last to the first.
9| And when they came that [were hired] about the eleventh
 hour, they received every man a penny.
10| But when the first came, they supposed that they should
 receive more; and they likewise received every man a penny.
11| And when they had received [it], they murmured against the
 master of the house.
12| Saying, These last have wrought [but] one hour, and thou
 hast made them equal to us, who have borne the burden and heat
 of the day.
13| But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee
 no wrong: didst thou not agree with me for a penny?
14| Take [that] which [is] thine, and depart: I will give to
 this last, even as to thee.
15| Or is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own? is
 thy eye evil because I am good?
16| So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many
 are called, but few chosen.
17| And Jesus going up to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples
 apart in the way, and said to them,
18| Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man will be
 betrayed to the chief priests, and to the scribes, and they
 will condemn him to death,
19| And will deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to
 scourge, and to crucify [him]: and the third day he will rise
 again.
20| Then came to him the mother of Zebedee's children, with
 her sons, worshiping [him], and desiring a certain thing of
 him.
21| And he said to her, What wilt thou: She saith to him,
 Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right
 hand, and the other on thy left hand in thy kingdom.
22| But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are
 ye able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, or to be
 baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say to
 him, We are able.
23| And he saith to them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and
 be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to
 sit on my right hand, and on my left hand, is not mine to give, but
 [it shall be given] to them for whom it is prepared by my
 Father.
24| And when the ten heard [it], they were moved with
 indignation against the two brethren.
25| But Jesus called them [to him], and said, Ye know that the
 princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
 that are great exercise authority upon them.
26| But it shall not be so among you: but whoever will be
 great among you, shall be your minister;
27| And whoever will be chief among you, let him be your
 servant:
28| Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered to, but
 to minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.
29| And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude
 followed him.
30| And behold, two blind men sitting by the way-side, when
 they heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy
 on us, O Lord, [thou] son of David.
31| And the multitude rebuked them, that they should hold
 their peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us,
 O Lord, [thou] son of David.
32| And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What
 will ye that I shall do to you?
33| They say to him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.
34| So Jesus had compassion [on them], and touched their eyes:
 and immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed
 him.
#21
1| And when they drew nigh to Jerusalem, and had come to
 Bethsphage, to the mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two
 disciples,
2| Saying to them, Go into the village over against you, and
 immediately ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her,
 loose [them], and bring [them] to me.
3| And if any [man] shall say aught to you, ye shall say, The
 Lord hath need of them; and immediately he will send them.
4| All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
 spoken by the prophet, saying,
5| Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh to
 thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
 ass.
6| And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,
7| And brought the ass and the colt, and put on them their
 clothes, and he sat thereon.
8| And a very great multitude spread their garments in the
 way; others cut down branches from the trees, and strewed
 [them] in the way.
9| And the multitudes that went before, and that followed,
 cried, saying, Hosanna to the son of David: blessed [is] he
 that cometh in the name of the Lord: Hosanna in the highest.
10| And when he had come into Jerusalem, all the city was
 moved, saying, Who is this?
11| And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of
 Nazareth of Galilee.
12| And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all
 them that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the
 tables of the money-changers, and the seats of them that sold
 doves.
13| And said to them, It is written, My house shall be called
 the house of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves.
14| And the lame and the  blind came to him in the temple; and
 he healed them.
15| And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
 things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
 saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were greatly
 displeased,
16| And said to him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
 saith to them, Yes: have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
 babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?
17| And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany,
 and he lodged there.
18| Now in the morning as he was returning into the city, he
 was hungry.
19| And when he saw a fig-tree in the way, he came to it, and
 found nothing on it, but leaves only, and said to it, Let no
 fruit grow on thee henceforth for ever. And immediately the
 fig-tree withered.
20| And when the disciples saw [it], they marveled, saying,
 How soon is the fig-tree withered!
21| Jesus answered and said to them, Verily I say to you, If
 ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this [which
 is done] to the fig-tree, but also, if ye shall say to this
 mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it
 shall be done.
22| And all things whatever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
 ye shall receive.
23| And when he had come into the temple, the chief priests
 and the presbyters of the people came to him as he was teaching,
 and said, By what authority doest thou these things; and who
 gave thee this authority?
24| And Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you
 one thing, which if ye tell me, I also will tell you by what
 authority I do these things.
25| The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or from
 men? And they reasoned with themselves, saying, if we shall
 say, From heaven; he will say to us, Why then did ye not
 believe him?
26| But if we shall say, From men; we fear the people: for all
 hold John as a prophet.
27| And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he
 said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do
 these things.
28| But what think ye? A [certain] man had two sons; and he
 came to the first, and said, Son, go, work to-day in my
 vineyard.
29| He answered and said, I will not; but afterward he
 repented, and went.
30| And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he
 answered and said, I [go], sir: and went not.
31| Which of the two did the will of [his] father? They say to
 him, The first. Jesus saith to them, Verily I say to you, that
 the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of God before
 you.
32| For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and ye
 believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed
 him: and ye, when ye had seen [it], repented not afterward,
 that ye might believe him.
33| Hear another parable; There was a certain householder, who
 planted a vineyard, and hedged it around, and digged a
 wine-press in it, and built a tower, and let it out to
 husbandmen, and went into a remote country:
34| And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his
 servants to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits
 of it.
35| And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and
 killed another, and stoned another.
36| Again he sent other servants more than the first: and they
 did to them in like manner.
37| But last of all he sent to them his son, saying, They will
 reverence my son.
38| But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
 themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let us
 seize on his inheritance.
39| And they caught him, and cast [him] out of the vineyard,
 and slew [him].
40| When therefore the Lord of the vineyard cometh, what will
 he do to those husbandmen?
41| They say to him, He will miserably destroy those wicked
 men, and will let out [his] vineyard to other husbandmen, who
 will render him the fruits in their seasons.
42| Jesus saith to them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
 The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
 head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is
 marvelous in our eyes?
43| Therefore I say to you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
 from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits of
 it.
44| And whoever shall fall on this stone, shall be broken: but
 on whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.
45| And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his
 parables, they perceived that he spoke of them.
46| But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
 multitude, because they took him for a prophet.
#22
1| And Jesus answered, and spoke to them again by parables,
 and said,
2| The kingdom of heaven is like to a certain king, who made a
 marriage for his son,
3| And sent his servants to call them that were invited to the
 wedding: and they would not come.
4| Again, he sent other servants, saying, Tell them who are
 invited, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and [my]
 fatlings [are] killed, and all things [are] ready: come to the
 marriage.
5| But they made light of [it], and went, one to his farm,
 another to his merchandise.
6| And the remnant took his servants, and treated [them]
 spitefully, and slew [them].
7| But when that king heard [of it], he was wroth: and he sent
 his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up their
 city.
8| Then he saith to his servants, The wedding is ready, but
 they who were invited were not worthy.
9| Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall
 find, invite to the marriage.
10| So those servants went out into the highways, and
 collected all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
 wedding was furnished with guests.
11| And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there
 a man who had not a wedding-garment:
12| And he saith to him, Friend, how camest thou in hither,
 not having a wedding-garment? And he was speechless.
13| Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and
 foot, and take him away, and cast [him] into utter darkness:
 there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
14| For many are called, but few [are] chosen.
15| Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
 entangle him in [his] talk.
16| And they sent out to him their disciples, with the
 Herodians, saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and
 teachest the way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any
 [man]: for thou regardest not the person of men.
17| Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to
 give tribute to Cesar, or not?
18| But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt
 ye me, [ye] hypocrites?
19| Show me the tribute-money. And they brought to him a
 penny.
20| And he saith to them, Whose [is] this icon, and
 superscription?
21| They say to him, Cesar's. Then saith he to them, Render
 therefore to Cesar, the things which are Cesar's; and to God,
 the things that are God's.
22| When they had heard [these words], they marveled, and left
 him, and departed.
23| The same day came to him the Sadducees, who say that there
 is no resurrection, and asked him,
24| Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man shall die, having no
 children, his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed
 to his brother.
25| Now there were with us seven brothers: and the first, when
 he had married a wife, deceased; and having no issue, left his
 wife to his brother.
26| Likewise the second also, and the third, to the seventh.
27| And last of all the woman died also.
28| Therefore in the resurrection, whose wife shall she be of
 the seven? for they all had her.
29| Jesus answered and said to them, Ye do err, not knowing
 the scriptures, nor the power of God.
30| For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given
 in marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.
31| But as concerning the resurrection of the dead, have ye
 not read that which was spoken to you by God, saying,
32| I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God
 of Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.
33| And when the multitude heard [this], they were astonished
 at his doctrine.
34| But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the
 Sadducees to silence, they were assembled about him.
35| Then one of them [who was] a lawyer, asked [him a
 question], tempting him, and saying,
36| Master, which [is] the great commandment in the law?
37| Jesus said to him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with
 all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.
38| This is the first and great commandment.
39| And the second [is] like it, Thou shalt love thy neighbor
 as thyself.
40| On these two commandments hang all the law and the
 prophets.
41| While the Pharisees were assembled, Jesus asked them,
42| Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
 to him, [The son] of David.
43| He saith to them, How then doth David in spirit call him
 Lord, saying,
44| The LORD said to my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till
 I make thy enemies thy footstool?
45| If David then calleth him Lord, how is he his son?
46| And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst
 any [man], from that day forth, ask him any more questions.
#23
1| Then Jesus spoke to the multitude, and to his disciples,
2| Saying, The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses's seat.
3| All therefore, whatever they bid you observe, [that]
 observe and do: but do not ye according to their works: for
 they say, and do not.
4| For they bind heavy burdens, and grievous to be borne, and
 lay [them] on men's shoulders; but they [themselves] will not
 move them with one of their fingers.
5| But all their works they do to be seen by men: they make
 broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
 garments,
6| And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats
 in the synagogues,
7| And greetings in the markets, and to be called by men,
 Rabbi, Rabbi.
8| But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, [even]
 Christ; and all ye are brethren.
9| And call no [man] your father upon the earth: for one is
 your Father who is in heaven.
10| Neither be ye called masters: for one is your master,
 [even] Christ.
11| But he that is greatest among you, shall be your servant.
12| And whoever shall exalt himself, shall be abased; and he
 that shall humble himself, shall be exalted.
13| (14) Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
 devour widows' houses, and for a pretense make long prayer:
 therefore ye shall receive the greater damnation.
14| (13) But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees! hypocrites! for ye
 shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go in
 [yourselves], neither suffer ye them that are entering, to go
 in.
15| Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
 compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is
 made, ye make him two-fold more the child of hell than
 yourselves.
16| Woe to you, [ye] blind guides, who say, Whoever shall
 swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whoever shall swear by
 the gold of the temple, he is a debtor.
17| [Ye] fools, and blind: for which is greater, the gold, or
 the temple that sanctifieth the gold?
18| And whoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but
 whoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.
19| [Ye] fools, and blind: for which [is] greater, the gift,
 or the altar that sanctifieth the gift?
20| Whoever therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by
 it, and by all things upon it.
21| And whoever shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and
 by him that dwelt in it.
22| And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne
 of God, and by him that sitteth upon it.
23| Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
 tithe of mint, and anise, and cummin, and have omitted the
 weightier [matters] of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:
 these ye ought to have done, and not to leave the others
 undone.
24| [Ye] blind guides, who strain out a gnat, and swallow a
 camel.
25| Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
 clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within
 they are full of extortion and unrighteousness.
26| [Thou] blind Pharisee, cleanse first that [which is]
 within the cup and platter, that the outside of them may be
 clean also.
27| Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are
 like whitened sepulchers, which indeed appear beautiful
 outward, but are within full of dead [men's] bones, and of all
 uncleanness.
28| Thus ye also outwardly appear righteous to men, but within
 ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.
29| Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
 build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchers of
 the righteous,
30| And say, If we had been in the days of our fathers, we
 would not have been partakers with them in the blood of the
 prophets.
31| Wherefore ye are witnesses to yourselves, that ye are the
 children of them who killed the prophets.
32| Fill ye up then the measure of your fathers.
33| [Ye] serpents, [ye] generation of vipers, how can ye
 escape the damnation of hell?
34| Wherefore behold, I send to you prophets, and wise men,
 and scribes; and [some] of them ye will kill and crucify, and
 [some] of them ye will scourge in your synagogues, and
 persecute [them] from city to city:
35| That upon you may come all the righteous blood shed upon
 the earth, from the blood of righteous Abel, to the blood of
 Zacharias son of Barachias, whom ye slew between the temple and
 the altar.
36| Verily I say to you, all these things shall come upon this
 generation.
37| O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, [thou] that killest the prophets,
 and stonest them who are sent to thee, how often would I have
 gathered thy children, even as a hen gathereth her chickens
 under [her] wings, and ye would not!
38| Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
39| For I say to you, Ye shall not see me henceforth, till ye
 shall say, Blessed [is] he that cometh in the name of the Lord.
#24
1| And Jesus went out, and departed from the temple: and his
 disciples came to [him] to show him the buildings of the
 temple.
2| And Jesus said to them, See ye not all these things? verily
 I say to you, There shall not be left here one stone upon
 another, that shall not be thrown down.
3| And as he sat upon the mount of Olives, the disciples came
 to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be?
 and what [will be] the sign of thy coming, and of the end of
 the world?
4| And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no man
 deceive you.
5| For many will come in my name, saying, I am Christ; and
 will deceive many.
6| And ye will hear of wars, and rumors of wars: see that ye
 be not troubled: for all [these things] must come to pass, but
 the end is not yet.
7| For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against
 kingdom: and there will be famines, and pestilences, and
 earthquakes in divers places.
8| All these [are] the beginning of sorrows.
9| Then will they deliver you up to be afflicted, and will
 kill you: and ye will be hated by all nations for my name's
 sake.
10| And then will many be offended, and will betray one
 another, and will hate one another.
11| And many false prophets will rise, and will deceive many.
12| And because iniquity will abound, the love of many will
 become cold.
13| But he that shall endure to the end, the same shall be
 saved.
14| And this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all
 the world, for a testimony to all nations; and then shall the
 end come.
15| When therefore ye shall see the abomination of desolation
 spoken of by Daniel the prophet, stand in the holy place,
 (whoever readeth, let him understand,)
16| Then let them who are in Judea flee to the mountains:
17| Let him who is on the house-top not come down to take the
 things out of his house:
18| Neither let him who is in the field return back to take
 his clothes.
19| And woe to them that are with child, and to them that
 nurse infants in those days!
20| But pray ye that your flight may not be in the winter,
 neither the sabbath:
21| For then shall be great tribulation, such as hath not been
 since the beginning of the world to this time, no, nor ever
 shall be.
22| And except those days should be shortened, there would no
 flesh be saved: but for the elect's sake those days shall be
 shortened.
23| Then if any man shall say to you, Lo, here [is] Christ, or
 there; believe [it] not.
24| For false Christs will arise, and false prophets, and will
 show great signs and wonders; so that, if [it were] possible,
 they would deceive the very elect.
25| Behold, I have told you before.
26| Wherefore, if they shall say to you, Behold, he is in the
 desert; go not forth: behold, [he is] in the secret chambers;
 believe [it] not.
27| For as the lightning cometh out of the east, and shineth
 even to the west; so shall also the coming of the Son of man
 be.
28| For wherever the carcass is, there will the eagles be
 collected.
29| Immediately after the tribulation of those days, shall the
 sun be darkened, and the moon shall not give her light, and the
 stars shall fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens
 shall be shaken:
30| And then shall appear the sign of the Son of man in
 heaven: and then shall all the tribes of the earth mourn, and
 they shall see the Son of man coming in the clouds of heaven
 with power and great glory.
31| And he will send his angels with a great sound of a
 trumpet, and they will gather his elect from the four winds,
 from one end of heaven to the other.
32| Now learn a parable of the fig-tree; When its branch is
 yet tender and putteth forth leaves, ye know that summer [is]
 nigh:
33| So likewise ye, when ye shall see all these things, know
 that it is near, [even at] the doors.
34| Verily I say to you, This generation shall not pass, till
 all these things shall be fulfilled.
35| Heaven and earth shall pass away, but my words shall not
 pass away.
36| But of that day and hour knoweth no [man], no, not the
 angels of heaven, but my Father only.
37| But as the days of Noe [were], so will also the coming of
 the Son of man be.
38| For as in the days that were before the flood, they were
 eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the
 day that Noe entered into the ark,
39| And knew not until the flood came, and took them all away:
 so also will be the coming of the Son of man.
40| Then will two be in the field; the one shall be taken, and
 the other left.
41| Two [women will be] grinding at the mill; the one shall be
 taken, and the other left.
42| Watch therefore; for ye know not what hour your Lord
 cometh.
43| But know this, that if the master of the house knew in
 what watch the thief would come, he would watch, and would not
 suffer his house to be broken up.
44| Therefore be ye also ready: for in such an hour as ye
 think not, the Son of man cometh.
45| Who then is a faithful and wise servant, whom his Lord
 hath made ruler over his household, to give them food in due
 season?
46| Blessed [is] that servant, whom his lord, when he cometh,
 shall find so doing.
47| Verily I say to you, that he will make him ruler over all
 his goods.
48| But if that evil servant shall say in his heart, My Lord
 delayeth his coming;
49| And shall begin to beat [his] fellow-servants, and to eat
 and drink with the drunken;
50| The Lord of that servant will come in a day when he
 looketh not for [him], and in an hour that he is not aware of,
51| And will cut him asunder, and appoint [him] his portion
 with the hypocrites: there shall be weeping and gnashing of
 teeth.
#25
1| Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened to ten virgins,
 who took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
2| And five of them were wise, and five [were] foolish.
3| They that [were] foolish took their lamps, and took no oil
 with them:
4| But the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps.
5| While the bridegroom tarried, they all slumbered and slept.
6| And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the
 bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him.
7| Then all those virgins arose, and trimmed their lamps.
8| And the foolish said to the wise, Give us of your oil: for
 our lamps are gone out.
9| But the wise answered, saying, [Not so]; lest there be not
 enough for us and you: but go ye rather to them that sell, and
 buy for yourselves.
10| And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came; and
 they that were ready, went in with him to the marriage, and the
 door was shut.
11| Afterward came also the other virgins, saying, Lord, Lord,
 open to us.
12| But he answered and said, Verily I say to you, I know you
 not.
13| Watch therefore, for ye know neither the day nor the hour
 in which the Son of man cometh.
14| For [the kingdom of heaven is] as a man traveling into a
 far country, [who] called his own servants, and delivered to
 them his goods.
15| And to one he gave five talents, to another two, and to
 another one; to every man according to his several ability; and
 forthwith took his journey.
16| Then he that had received the five talents, went and
 traded with the same, and gained other five talents.
17| And likewise he that [had received] two, he also gained
 other two.
18| But he that had received one, went and digged in the
 earth, and hid his lord's money.
19| After a long time the lord of those servants cometh, and
 reckoneth with them.
20| And he that had received five talents, came and brought
 other five talents, saying, Lord, thou deliveredst to me five
 talents: behold, I have gained besides them five talents more.
21| His lord said to him, Well done [thou] good and faithful
 servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
 thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy
 lord.
22| He also that had received two talents came, and said,
 Lord, thou deliveredst to me two talents: behold, I have gained
 two other talents besides them.
23| His lord said to him, Well done, good and faithful
 servant; thou hast been faithful over a few things, I will make
 thee ruler over many things: enter thou into the joy of thy
 lord.
24| Then he who had received the one talent came, and said,
 Lord, I knew thee that thou art a hard man, reaping where thou
 hast not sown, and gathering where thou hast not strewed:
25| And I was afraid, and went and hid thy talent in the
 earth: lo, [there] thou hast [what is] thine.
26| His lord answered and said to him, [Thou] wicked and
 slothful servant, thou knewest that I reap where I have not
 sown, and gather where I have not strewed:
27| Thou oughtest therefore to have put my money to the
 exchangers, and [then] at my coming I should have received my
 own with interest.
28| Take therefore the talent from him, and give [it] to him
 who hath ten talents.
29| For to every one that hath shall be given, and he shall
 have abundance: but from him that hath not shall be taken away
 even that which he hath.
30| And cast ye the unprofitable servant into utter darkness:
 there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
31| When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the
 holy angels with him, then will he sit upon the throne of his
 glory:
32| And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he will
 separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth [his]
 sheep from the goats:
33| And he will set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats
 on the left.
34| Then will the King say to them on his right hand, Come, ye
 blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from
 the foundation of the world:
35| For I was hungry, and ye gave me food: I was thirsty, and
 ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:
36| Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I
 was in prison, and ye came to me.
37| Then will the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw
 we thee hungry, and fed [thee]? or thirsty, and gave [thee]
 drink?
38| When saw we thee a stranger, and took [thee] in? or naked,
 and clothed [thee]?
39| Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came to thee?
40| And the king will answer and say to them, Verily I say to
 you, Inasmuch as ye have done [it] to one of the least of these
 my brethren, ye have done [it] to me.
41| Then will he say also to them on the left hand, Depart
 from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the
 devil and his angels:
42| For I was hungry, and ye gave me no food: I was thirsty,
 and ye gave me no drink:
43| I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye
 clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.
44| Then will they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we
 thee hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or
 in prison, and did not minister to thee?
45| Then will he answer them, saying, Verily I say to you,
 Inasmuch as ye did [it] not to one of the least of these, ye
 did [it] not to me.
46| And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but
 the righteous into life eternal.
#26
1| And it came to pass, when Jesus had finished all these
 sayings, he said to his disciples,
2| Ye know that after two days is the Pascha, and the Son of
 man is betrayed to be crucified.
3| Then assembled the chief priests, and the scribes, and the
 presbyters of the people, in the palace of the high priest, who was
 called Caiaphas,
4| And consulted that they might take Jesus by subtilty, and
 kill [him].
5| But they said, Not on the feast-[day], lest there be an
 uproar among the people.
6| Now when Jesus was in Bethany, in the house of Simon the
 leper,
7| There came to him a woman having an alabaster-box of very
 precious ointment, and poured it on his head as he sat [at
 table].
8| But when his disciples saw [it], they had indignation,
 saying, To what purpose [is] this waste?
9| For this ointment might have been sold for much, and given
 to the poor.
10| When Jesus understood [it], he said to them, Why trouble
 ye the woman? for she hath wrought a good work upon me.
11| For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not
 always.
12| For in that she hath poured this ointment on my body, she
 did [it] for my burial.
13| Verily I say to you, Wherever this gospel shall be
 preached in the whole world, [there] shall also this, which
 this woman hath done, be told for a memorial of her.
14| Then one of the twelve, called Judas Iscariot, went to the
 chief priests,
15| And said, What will ye give me, and I will deliver him to
 you? And they covenanted with him for thirty pieces of silver.
16| And from that time he sought opportunity to betray him.
17| Now the first [day] of the [feast of] unleavened bread,
 the disciples came to Jesus, saying to him, Where wilt thou
 that we prepare for thee to eat the Pascha?
18| And he said, Go into the city to such a man, and say to
 him, The Master saith, My time is at hand; I will keep the
 Pascha at thy house with my disciples.
19| And the disciples did as Jesus had appointed them; and
 they made ready the Pascha.
20| Now when the evening was come, he sat down with the
 twelve.
21| And as they were eating, he said, Verily I say to you,
 that one of you will betray me.
22| And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one of
 them to say to him, Lord, is it I?
23| And he answered and said, He that dippeth [his] hand with
 me in the dish, the same will betray me.
24| The Son of man goeth, as it is written concerning him: but
 woe to that man by whom the Son of man is betrayed! it had been
 good for that man, if he had not been born.
25| Then Judas, who betrayed him, answered and said, Master,
 is it I? He said to him, Thou hast said.
26| And as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and blessed
 [it], and broke [it], and gave [it] to the disciples, and said,
 Take, eat; this is my body.
27| And he took the cup, and gave thanks, and gave [it] to
 them, saying, Drink ye all of it;
28| For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed
 for many for the remission of sin.
29| But I say to you, I will not drink henceforth of this
 fruit of the vine, until that day when I drink it new with you
 in my Father's kingdom.
30| And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the mount
 of Olives.
31| Then saith Jesus to them, All ye shall be offended because
 of me this night: for it is written, I will smite the shepherd,
 and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad.
32| But after I am risen again, I will go before you into
 Galilee.
33| Peter answered and said to him, Though all [men] shall be
 offended because of thee, [yet] will I never be offended.
34| Jesus said to him, Verily I say to thee, that this night,
 before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice.
35| Peter said to him, Though I should die with thee, yet will
 I not deny thee. But likewise also said all the disciples.
36| Then cometh Jesus with them to a place called Gethsemane,
 and saith to the disciples, Sit ye here, while I go yonder and
 pray.
37| And he took with him Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee,
 and began to be sorrowful and very heavy.
38| Then saith Jesus to them, My soul is exceeding sorrowful,
 even to death: tarry ye here, and watch with me.
39| And he went a little further, and fell on his face, and
 prayed, saying, O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup
 pass from me: nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou [wilt].
40| And he cometh to the disciples, and findeth them asleep,
 and saith to Peter, What, could ye not watch with me one hour?
41| Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation: the
 spirit indeed [is] willing, but the flesh [is] weak.
42| He went away again the second time, and prayed, saying, O
 my Father, if this cup may not pass away from me, except I
 drink it, thy will be done.
43| And he came and found them asleep again: for their eyes
 were heavy.
44| And he left them, and went away again, and prayed the
 third time, saying the same words.
45| Then he cometh to his disciples, and saith to them, Sleep
 on now, and take [your] rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and
 the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
46| Rise, let us be going: behold, he is at hand that doth
 betray me.
47| And while he was yet speaking, lo, Judas, one of the
 twelve, came, and with him a great multitude with swords and
 staffs, from the chief priests and presbyters of the people.
48| Now he that betrayed him, gave them a sign, saying,
 Whomsoever I shall kiss, that same is he; hold him fast.
49| And forthwith he came to Jesus, and said, Hail Master; and
 kissed him.
50| And Jesus said to him, Friend, Why art thou come? Then
 they came, and laid hands on Jesus, and took him.
51| And behold, one of them, who were with Jesus, stretched
 out [his] hand, and drew his sword, and struck a servant of the
 high priest, and smote off his ear.
52| Then said Jesus to him, Put up again thy sword into its
 place: for all they that take the sword, shall die by the
 sword.
53| Thinkest thou that I cannot now pray to my Father, and he
 will presently give me more than twelve legions of angels?
54| But how then shall the scriptures be fulfilled, that thus
 it must be?
55| In that same hour said Jesus to the multitudes, Are ye
 come out as against a thief with swords and staffs to take me?
 I sat daily with you teaching in the temple, and ye laid no
 hold on me.
56| But all this was done, that the scriptures of the prophets
 might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples forsook him, and
 fled.
57| And they that had laid hold on Jesus, led [him] away to
 Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the presbyters were
 assembled.
58| But Peter followed him at a distance, to the high priest's
 palace, and went in, and sat with the servants to see the end.
59| Now the chief priests and presbyters, and all the council,
 sought false testimony against Jesus, to put him to death;
60| But found none: and, though many false witnesses came,
 [yet] found they none. At the last came two false witnesses,
61| And said, This [man] said, I am able to destroy the temple
 of God, and to build it in three days.
62| And the high priest arose, and said to him, Answerest thou
 nothing, what [is it which] these testify against thee?
63| But Jesus held his peace. And the high priest answered and
 said to him, I adjure thee by the living God, that thou tell us
 whether thou art the Christ the Son of God.
64| Jesus saith to him, Thou hast said: nevertheless I say to
 you, Hereafter shall ye see the Son of man sitting on the right
 hand of power, and coming in the clouds of heaven.
65| Then the high priest rent his clothes, saying, He hath
 spoken blasphemy; what further need have we of witnesses?
 behold, now ye have heard his blasphemy.
66| What think ye? They answered and said, He is guilty of
 death.
67| Then they spit in his face, and buffetted him; and others
 smote [him] with the palms of their hands,
68| Saying, Prophesy to us, thou Christ, Who is he that smote
 thee?
69| Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came to
 him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.
70| But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what
 thou sayest.
71| And when he had gone out into the porch, another [maid]
 saw him, and said to them that were there, This [man] was also
 with Jesus of Nazareth.
72| And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the man.
73| And after a while came to [him] they that stood by, and
 said to Peter, Surely thou also art [one] of them; for thy
 speech betrayeth thee.
74| Then began he to curse and to swear, [saying], I know not
 the man. And immediately the cock crowed.
75| And Peter remembered the word of Jesus, who said to him,
 Before the cock shall crow, thou wilt deny me thrice. And he
 went out, and wept bitterly.
#27
1| When the morning was come, all the chief priests and presbyters
 of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death.
2| And when they had bound him, they led [him] away, and
 delivered him to Pontius Pilate the governor.
3| Then Judas, who had betrayed him, when he saw that he was
 condemned, repented and brought again the thirty pieces of
 silver to the chief priests and presbyters,
4| Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed innocent
 blood. And they said, What [is that] to us? see thou [to that].
5| And he cast down the pieces of silver in the temple, and
 departed, and went and hanged himself.
6| And the chief priests took the silver pieces, and said, It
 is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the
 price of blood.
7| And they took counsel, and bought with them the potter's
 field, to bury strangers in.
8| Wherefore that field has been called, The field of blood,
 to this day.
9| Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremias the
 prophet, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the
 price of him that was valued, whom they of the children of
 Israel did value;
10| And gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord
 appointed me.
11| And Jesus stood before the governor: and the governor
 asked him, saying, Art thou the King of the Jews? And Jesus
 said to him, Thou sayest.
12| And when he was accused by the chief priests and presbyters,
 he answered nothing.
13| Then saith Pilate to him, Hearest thou not how many things
 they testify against thee?
14| And he answered him to not a word; so that the governor
 marveled greatly.
15| Now at [that] feast, the governor was wont to release to
 the people a prisoner, whom they would.
16| And they had then a notable prisoner, called Barabbas.
17| Therefore when they were assembled, Pilate said to them,
 Whom will ye that I release to you? Barabbas, or Jesus, who is
 called Christ?
18| (For he knew that for envy they had delivered him.)
19| When he was sitting on the judgment-seat, his wife sent to
 him, saying, Have thou nothing to do with that just man: for I
 have suffered many things this day in a dream, because of him.
20| But the chief priests and presbyters persuaded the multitude
 that they should ask Barabbas, and destroy Jesus.
21| The governor answered and said to them, Which of the two
 will ye that I release to you? They said, Barabbas.
22| Pilate saith to them, What shall I do then with Jesus, who
 is called Christ? [They] all say to him, Let him be crucified.
23| And the governor said, Why, what evil hath he done? But
 they cried out the more, saying, Let him be crucified.
24| When Pilate saw that he could not prevail at all, but
 [that] rather a tumult was made, he took water, and washed
 [his] hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the
 blood of this just person: see ye [to it].
25| Then answered all the people, and said, His blood [be] on
 us, and on our children.
26| Then he released Barabbas to them: and when he had
 scourged Jesus, he delivered [him] to be crucified.
27| Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the
 common hall, and gathered to him the whole band [of soldiers].
28| And they stripped him, and put on him a scarlet robe.
29| And when they had platted a crown of thorns, they put [it]
 upon his head, and a reed in his right hand: and they bowed the
 knee before him, and mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the
 Jews?
30| And they spit upon him, and took the reed, and struck him
 on the head.
31| And after that they had mocked him, they took the robe off
 from him, and put his own raiment on him, and led him away to
 crucify [him].
32| And as they came out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by
 name: him they constrained to bear his cross.
33| And when they had come to a place called Golgotha, that is
 to say, a place of a skull,
34| They gave him vinegar to drink, mingled with gall: and
 when he had tasted [of it], he would not drink.
35| And they crucified him, and parted his garments, casting
 lots:
36| And sitting down, they watched him there:
37| And set up over his head his accusation written, THIS IS
 JESUS THE KING OF THE JEWS.
38| Then were there two thieves crucified with him: one on the
 right hand, and another on the left.
39| And they that passed by, reviled him, wagging their heads,
40| And saying, Thou that destroyest the temple, and buildest
 [it] in three days, save thyself. If thou art the Son of God,
 come down from the cross.
41| Likewise also the chief priests mocking [him], with the
 scribes and presbyters and the Pharisees, said,
42| He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he is King of
 Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will
 believe on him.
43| He trusted in God; let him deliver him now if he will have
 him: for he said, I am the Son of God.
44| The thieves also who were crucified with him, cast the
 same in his teeth.
45| Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the
 land to the ninth hour.
46| And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice,
 saying, Eli, Eli, lima sabachthani? that is to say, My God, my
 God, why hast thou forsaken me?
47| Some of them that stood there, when they heard [that],
 said, This [man] calleth for Elias.
48| And immediately one of them ran, and took a spunge, and
 filled [it] with vinegar, and put [it] on a reed, and gave him
 to drink.
49| The rest said, Forbear, let us see whether Elias will
 come to save him.
50| Jesus, when he had cried again with a loud voice, expired.
51| And behold, the vail of the temple was rent in two, from
 the top to the bottom: and the earth shook, and the rocks rent;
52| And the graves were opened, and many bodies of saints who
 slept, arose,
53| And came out of the graves after his resurrection, and
 went into the holy city, and appeared to many.
54| Now when the centurion, and they that were with him,
 watching Jesus, saw the earthquake, and those things that were
 done, they feared greatly, saying, Truly this was the Son of
 God.
55| And many women were there (beholding at a distance) who
 followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him:
56| Among whom was Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of
 James and Joses, and the mother of Zebedee's children.
57| When the evening was come, there came a rich man of
 Arimathea, named Joseph, who also himself was a disciple of
 Jesus.
58| He went to Pilate, and begged the body of Jesus. Then
 Pilate commanded the body to be delivered.
59| And when Joseph had taken the body, he wrapped it in a
 clean linen cloth,
60| And laid it in his own new tomb, which he had hewn out in
 the rock; and he rolled a great stone to the door of the
 sepulcher, and departed.
61| And there was Mary Magdalene, and the other Mary, sitting
 over against the sepulcher.
62| Now the next day that followed the day of the preparation,
 the chief priests and Pharisees came together to Pilate,
63| Saying, Sir, we remember that that deceiver said, while he
 was yet alive, After three days I will rise again.
64| Command therefore that the sepulcher be made secure until
 the third day, lest his disciples come by night, and steal him
 away, and say to the people, He is risen from the dead: so the
 last error will be worse than the first.
65| Pilate said to them, Ye have a watch: go, make [it] as
 secure as ye can.
66| So they went, and having sealed the stone, made the
 sepulcher secure with a watch.
#28
1| In the end of the sabbath, as it began to dawn towards the
 first [day] of the week, came Mary Magdalene, and the other
 Mary to see the sepulcher.
2| And behold, there was a great earthquake: for the angel of
 the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the
 stone from the door, and sat upon it.
3| His countenance was like lightning, and his raiment white
 as snow.
4| And for fear of him the keepers trembled and became as dead
 [men].
5| And the angel answered and said to the women, Fear ye not:
 for I know that ye seek Jesus, who was crucified.
6| He is not here: for he is risen, as he said. Come, see the
 place where the Lord lay.
7| And go quickly, and tell his disciples, that he is risen
 from the dead, and behold, he goeth before you into Galilee;
 there shall ye see him: lo, I have told you.
8| And they departed quickly from the sepulcher, with fear and
 great joy; and ran to bring word to his disciples.
9| And as they were going to tell his disciples, behold, Jesus
 met them, saying, All hail. And they came, and held him by the
 feet, and worshiped him.
10| Then said Jesus to them, Be not afraid: go tell my
 brethren, that they go into Galilee, and there shall they see
 me.
11| Now when they were going, behold, some of the watch came
 into the city, and showed to the chief priests all the things
 that had been done.
12| And when they were assembled with the presbyters, and had
 taken counsel, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,
13| Saying, Say ye, His disciples came by night, and stole him
 [away] while we slept.
14| And if this shall come to the governor's ears, we will
 persuade him, and secure you.
15| So they took the money, and did as they were instructed:
 and this saying is commonly reported among the Jews until this
 day.
16| Then the eleven disciples went away into Galilee, to a
 mountain where Jesus had appointed them.
17| And when they saw him, they worshiped him: but some
 doubted.
18| And Jesus came, and spoke to them, saying, All power is
 given to me in heaven and upon earth.
19| Go ye and teach all nations, baptizing them in
 the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
20| Teaching them to observe all things whatever I have
 commanded you: and lo, I am with you always, [even] to the end
 of the world. Amen.
