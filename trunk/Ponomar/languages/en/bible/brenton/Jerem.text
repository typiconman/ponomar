1| The word of God which came to  Jeremias the <i>son</i> of Chelcias, of the priests, who dwelt in Anathoth in  the land of Benjamin: 
2| <i> accordingly</i> as the word of God came to him in the days of Josias son of Amos  king of Juda, in the thirteenth year of his reign. 
3| And it was in the days of Joakim, son of Josias king of  Juda, until the eleventh year of Sedekias king of Juda, <i>even</i> until the  captivity of Jerusalem in the fifth month.
4| And the word of the Lord came to him, <i>saying</i>, 
5| Before I formed  thee in the belly, I knew thee; and before thou camest forth from the womb, I  sanctified thee; I appointed thee a prophet to the nations.  
6| And I said, O Lord, thou that art  supreme Lord, behold, I know not <i>how</i> to speak, for I am a child.  
7| And the Lord said to me, Say not, I am a  child: for thou shalt go to all to whomsoever I shall send thee, and according  to all <i>the words</i> that I shall command thee, thou shalt speak.  
8| Be not afraid before them: for I am with  thee to deliver thee, saith the Lord. 
9|  And the Lord stretched forth his hand to me, and touched my  mouth: and the Lord said to me, Behold, I have put my words into thy mouth.  
10| Behold, I have appointed thee this  day over nations and over kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to  destroy, and to rebuild, and to plant.
11| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying, What seest thou? And I said, A rod of an almond tree.  
12| And the Lord said to me, Thou hast well  seen: for I have watched over my words to perform them. 
13| And the word of the Lord came to me a second time, saying,  What seest thou? And I said, A caldron on the fire; and the face of it is toward  the north. 
14| And the Lord said to  me, From the north shall flame forth evils upon all the inhabitants of the land. 
15| For, behold, I call together all  the kingdoms of the earth from the north, saith the Lord; and they shall come,  and shall set each one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and  against all the walls round about her, and against all the cities of Juda. 
16| And I will speak to them in  judgment, concerning all their iniquity, <i>forasmuch</i> as they have forsaken  me, and sacrificed to strange gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.  
17| And do thou gird up thy loins, and  stand up, and speak all <i>the words</i> that I shall command thee: be not  afraid of their face, neither be thou alarmed before them; for I am with thee to  deliver thee, saith the Lord. 
18|  Behold, I have made thee this day as a strong city, and as a brazen wall, strong <i>against</i> all the kings of Juda, and the princes thereof, and the people of  the land. 
19| And they shall fight  against thee; but they shall by no means prevail against thee; because I am with  thee, to deliver thee, saith the Lord. Chapter  2

1| And he said, Thus saith the Lord, 
2| I remember the kindness of thy  youth, and the love of thine espousals, 
3|  in following the Holy One of Israel, saith the Lord, Israel was  the holy <i>people</i> to the Lord, <i>and</i> the first-fruits of his increase:  all that devoured him shall offend; evils shall come upon them, saith the Lord.  
4| Hear the word of the Lord, O house of  Jacob, and every family of the house of Israel. 
5|  Thus saith the Lord, What trespass have your fathers found in me,  that they have revolted far from me, and gone after vanities, and become vain? 
6| And they said not, Where is the  Lord, who brought us up out of the land of Egypt, who guided us in the  wilderness, in an untried and trackless land, in a land which no man at all went  through, and no man dwelt there? 
7|  And I brought you to Carmel, that ye should eat the fruits thereof, and the good  thereof; and ye went in, and defiled my land, and made mine heritage an  abomination. 
8| The priests said not,  Where is the Lord? and they that held by the law knew me not: the shepherds also  sinned against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and went after that  which profited not.
9| Therefore I will yet plead with you,  and will plead with your children’s children. 
10|  For go to the isles of the Chettians, and se; and send to Kedar,  and observe accurately, and see if such things have been done;  
11| if the nations will change their gods,  though they are not gods: but my people have changed their glory, <i>for that</i>  from which they shall not be profited. 
12|  The heaven is amazed at this, and is very exceedingly  horror-struck, saith the Lord. 
13|  For my people has committed two <i>faults</i>, and evil ones: they have forsaken  me, the fountain of water of life, and hewn out for themselves broken cisterns,  which will not be able to hold water.
14| Is Israel a servant, or a home-born  slave? why has he become a spoil? 
15|  The lions roared upon him, and uttered their voice, which have  made his land a wilderness: and his cities are broken down, that they should not  be inhabited. 
16| Also the children  of Memphis and Taphnas have known thee, and mocked thee. 
 17| Has not thy forsaking me brought these things upon  thee? saith the Lord thy God.  
18| And now what hast thou to do with the  way of Egypt, to drink the water of Geon? and what hast thou to do with the way  of the Assyrians, to drink the water of rivers? 
19|  Thine apostasy shall correct thee, and thy wickedness shall  reprove thee: know then, and see, that thy forsaking me <i>has been</i> bitter  to thee, saith the Lord thy God; and I have taken no pleasure in thee, saith the  Lord thy God.
20| For of old thou hast broken thy yoke,  and plucked asunder thy bands; and thou has said, I will not serve thee, but  will go upon every high hill, and under every shady tree, there will I indulge  in my fornication. 
21| Yet I planted  thee a fruitful vine, entirely of the right sort: how art thou a strange vine  turned to bitterness! 
22| Though thou  shouldest wash thyself with nitre, and multiply to thyself soap, <i>still</i>  thou art stained by thine iniquities before me, saith the Lord.  
23| How wilt thou say, I am not polluted,  and have not gone after Baal? behold thy ways in the burial-ground, and know  what thou hast done: her voice has howled in the evening: 
 24| she has extended her ways over the waters of the  desert; she was hurried along by the lusts of her soul; she is given up <i>to  them</i>, who will turn her back? none that seek her shall be weary; at <i>the  time of</i> her humiliation they shall find her. 
25|  Withdraw thy foot from a rough way, and thy throat from thirst:  but she said I will strengthen myself: for she loved strangers, and went after  them.  
26| As is the shame of a thief when he is  caught, so shall the children of Israel be ashamed; they, and their kings, and  their princes, and their priests, and their prophets. 
27| They said to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone,  Thou has begotten me: and they have turned <i>their</i> backs to me, and not  their faces: yet in the time of their afflictions they will say, Arise, and save  us. 
28| And where are thy gods, which  thou madest for thyself? will they arise and save in the time of thine  affliction? for according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Juda; and  according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem they sacrificed to Baal. 
29| Wherefore do ye speak unto me? ye  all have been ungodly, and ye all have transgressed against me, saith the Lord. 
30| In vain have I smitten your  children; ye have not received correction: a sword has devoured your prophets as  a destroying lion; yet ye feared not.  
31| Hear ye the word of the Lord: thus  saith the Lord, Have I been a wilderness or a dry land to Israel? wherefore has  my people said, We will not be ruled over, and will not come to thee any more? 
32| Will a bride forget her  ornaments, or a virgin her girdle? but my people has forgotten me days without  number. 
33| What fair device wilt  thou yet employ in thy ways, so as to seek love? <i>it shall</i> not <i>be</i>  so; moreover thou has done wickedly in corrupting thy ways;  
34| and in thine hands has been found the  blood of innocent souls; I have not found them in holes, but on every oak. 
35| Yet thou saidst, I am innocent:  only let his wrath be turned away from me.  Behold, I <i>will</i> plead with thee, whereas thou sayest, I  have not sinned. 
36| For thou has  been so exceedingly contemptuous as to repeat thy ways; but thou shalt be  ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assur. 
37|  For thou shalt go forth thence also with thine hands upon thine  head; for the Lord has rejected thine hope, and thou shalt not prosper in it. Chapter  3

1| If a man put away his wife, and she  depart from him, and become another man’s, shall she return to him any more at  all? shall not that woman be utterly defiled? ye thou hast gone a-whoring with  many shepherds, and hast returned to me, saith the Lord. 
2| Lift up thine eyes <i>to look</i> straight forward, and  see where thou hast not been utterly defiled. Thou hast sat for them by the  wayside as a deserted crow, and hast defiled the land with thy fornications and  thy wickedness. 
3| And thou didst  retain many shepherds for a stumbling-block to thyself: thou hadst a whore’s  face, thou didst become shameless toward all.  
4| Hast thou not called me as it were a  home, and the father and guide of thy virgin-time? 
5| Will <i>God’s anger</i> continue for ever, or be preserved  to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done these bad things, and hadst power <i>to do them</i>.
6| And the Lord said to me in the days of  Josias the king, Hast thou seen what things the house of Israel has done to me?  they have gone on every high mountain, and under every shady tree, and have  committed fornication there. 
7| And I  said after she had committed all these acts of fornication, Turn again to me.  Yet she returned not. And faithless Juda saw her faithlessness.  
8| And I saw that (for all the sins of which  she was convicted, wherein the house of Israel committed adultery, and I put her  away, and gave into her hands a bill of divorcement,) yet faithless Juda feared  not, but went and herself also committed fornication. 
9| And her fornication was nothing accounted of; and she  committed adultery with wood and stone. 
10|  And for all these things faithless Juda turned not to me with all  her heart, but falsely.  
11| And the Lord said to me, Israel has  justified himself more than faithless Juda. 
12|  Go and read these words toward the north, and thou shalt say,  Return to me, O house of Israel, saith the Lord; and I will not set my face  against you: for I am merciful, saith the Lord, and I will not be angry with you  for ever. 
13| Nevertheless, know  thine iniquity, that thou hast sinned against the Lord thy God, and hast  scattered thy ways to strangers under every shady tree, but thou didst not  hearken to my voice, saith the Lord. 
14|  Turn, ye children that have revolted, saith the Lord; for I will  rule over you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I  will bring you in to Sion: 
15| and I  will give you shepherds after my heart, and they shall certainly tend you with  knowledge.  
16| And it shall come to pass that when  ye are multiplied and increased upon the land, saith the Lord, in those days  they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the Holy One of Israel: it  shall not come to mind; it shall not be named; neither shall it be visited; nor  shall <i>this</i> be done any more. 
17|  In those days and at that time they shall call Jerusalem the  throne of the Lord; and all the nations shall be gathered to it: and they shall  not walk any more after the imaginations of their evil heart.  
18| In those days the house of Juda,  shall come together to the house of Israel, and they shall come, together, from  the land of the north, and from all the countries, to the land, which I caused  their fathers to inherit. 
19| And I  said, So be it, Lord, for <i>thou saidst</i> I will set thee among children, and  will give thee a choice land, the inheritance of the Almighty God of the  Gentiles: and I said, Ye shall call me Father; and ye shall not turn away from  me. 
20| But as a wife acts  treacherously against her husband, so has the house of Israel dealt  treacherously against me, saith the Lord.  
21| A voice from the lips was heard, <i> even</i> of weeping and supplication of the children of Israel: for they have  dealt unrighteously in their ways, they have forgotten God their Holy One. 
22| Turn, ye children that are given  to turning, and I will heal your bruises.  Behold, we will be thy servants; for thou art the Lord our  God. 
23| Truly the hills and the  strength of the mountains were a lying refuge: but by the Lord our God is the  salvation of Israel. 
24| But shame  has consumed the labours of our fathers from our youth; their sheep and their  calves, and their sons and their daughters. 
25|  We have lain down in our shame, and our disgrace has covered us:  because we and our fathers have sinned before our God, from our youth until this  day; and we have not hearkened to the voice of the Lord our God. Chapter  4

1| If Israel will return to me, saith  the Lord, he shall return: and if he will remove his abominations out of his  mouth, and fear before me, and swear, 
2|  The Lord lives, with truth, in judgment and righteousness, then  shall nations bless by him, and by him they shall praise God in Jerusalem.
3| For thus saith the Lord to the men of  Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Break up fresh ground for yourselves,  and sow not among thorns. 
4|  Circumcise yourselves to your God, and circumcise your hardness of heart, ye men  of Juda, and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my wrath go forth as fire, and burn,  and there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your devices.
5| Declare ye in Juda, and let it be  heard in Jerusalem: say ye, Sound the trumpet in the land; cry ye aloud: say ye,  Gather yourselves together, and let us enter into the fortified cities.  
6| Gather up <i>your wares</i> and flee to  Sion: hasten, stay not: for I will bring evils from the north, and great  destruction. 
7| The lion is gone up  from his lair, he has roused <i>himself</i> to the destruction of the nations,  and has gone forth out of his place, to make the land desolate; and the cities  shall be destroyed, so as to be without inhabitant. 
8| For these things gird yourselves with sackclothes, and  lament, and howl: for the anger of the Lord is not turned away from you.  
9| And it shall come to pass in that day,  saith the Lord, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the  princes; and the priests shall be amazed, and the prophets shall wonder.   
10| And I said, O sovereign Lord, verily  thou hast deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, There shall be peace;  whereas behold, the sword has reached even to their soul.  
11| At that time they shall say to this  people and to Jerusalem, <i>There is</i> a spirit of error in the wilderness:  the way of the daughter of my people is not to purity, nor to holiness.  
12| <i>But</i> a spirit of full vengeance  shall come upon me; and now I declare my judgments against them.  
13| Behold, he shall come up as a cloud, and  his chariots as a tempest: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for  we are in misery.  
14| Cleanse thine heart from wickedness,  O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved: how long will thy grievous thoughts be  within thee? 
15| For a voice of one  publishing from Dan shall come, and trouble out of mount Ephraim shall be heard  of. 
16| Remind ye the nations;  behold, they are come: proclaim <i>it</i> in Jerusalem, that bands are  approaching from a land afar off, and have uttered their voice against the  cities of Juda. 
17| As keepers of a  field, they have surrounded her; because thou, saith the Lord, has neglected me. 
18| Thy ways and thy devices have  brought these things upon thee; this is thy wickedness, for <i>it is</i> bitter,  for it has reached to thy heart.
19| I am pained in my bowels, my bowels,  and the sensitive powers of my heart; my soul is in great commotion, my heart is  torn: I will not be silent, for my soul has heard the sound of a trumpet, the  cry of war, and of distress: it calls on destruction; 
20| for all the land is distressed: suddenly <i>my</i>  tabernacle is distressed, my curtains have been rent asunder.  
21| How long shall I see fugitives, and hear  the sound of the trumpet?  
22| For the princes of my people have not  known me, they are foolish and unwise children: they are wise to do evil, but <i> how</i> to do good they have not known.  
23| I looked upon the earth, and, behold, <i>it was</i> not; and to the sky, an there was no light in it.  
24| I beheld the mountains, and they  trembled, and <i>I saw</i> all the hills in commotion. 
25| I looked, and behold, there was no man, and all the birds  of the sky were scared. 
26| I saw,  and, behold, Carmel was desert, and all the cities were burnt with fire at the  presence of the Lord, and at the presence of his fierce anger they were utterly  destroyed.  
27| Thus saith the Lord, The whole land  shall be desolate; but I will not make a full end. 
28| For these things let the earth mourn, and let the sky be  dark above: for I have spoken, and I will not repent; I have purposed, and I  will not turn back from it. 
29| The  whole land has recoiled from the noise of the horseman and the bent bow; they  have gone into the caves, and have hidden themselves in the groves, and have  gone up upon the rocks: every city was abandoned, no man dwelt in them.  
30| And what wilt thou do? Though thou  clothe thyself with scarlet, and adorn thyself with golden ornaments; though  thou adorn thine eyes with stibium, thy beauty <i>will be</i> in vain: thy  lovers have rejected thee, they seek thy life.  
31| For I have heard thy groaning as the  voice of a woman in travail, as of her that brings forth her first child; the  voice of the daughter of Zion shall fail through weakness, and she shall lose  the strength of her hands, <i>saying</i>, Woe is me! for my soul faints because  of the slain. Chapter  5

1| Run ye about in the streets of  Jerusalem, and see, and know, and seek in her broad places, if ye can find <i> one</i>, if there is any one that does judgment, and seeks faithfulness; and I  will pardon them, saith the Lord. 
2|  The Lord lives, they say; do they not therefore swear falsely?  
3| O Lord, thine eyes are upon faithfulness:  thou hast scourged them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them; but  they would not receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a  rock; and they would not return. 
4|  Then I said, It may be they are poor; for they are weak, for they know not the  way of the Lord, or the judgment of God. 
5|  I will go to the rich men, and will speak to them; for they have  known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of God: but, behold, with one  consent they have broken the yoke, they have burst the bonds.  
6| Therefore has a lion out of the forest  smitten them, and a wolf has destroyed them even to <i>their</i> houses, and a  leopard has watched against their cities: all that go forth from them shall be  hunted: for they have multiplied their ungodliness, they have strengthened  themselves in their revoltings. 
7| In  what <i>way</i> shall I forgive thee for these things? Thy sons have forsaken  me, and sworn by them that are no gods: and I fed them to the full, and they  committed adultery, and lodged in harlots’ houses. 
8| They became as wanton horses: they neighed each one after  his neighbour’s wife. 
9| Shall I not  visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such  a nation as this.
10| Go up upon her battlements, and break <i>them</i> down; but make not a full end: leave her buttresses: for they are  the Lord’s. 
11| For the house of  Israel have indeed dealt treacherously against me, saith the Lord: the house of  Juda also 
12| have lied to their  Lord, and they have said, These things are not so; no evils shall come upon us;  and we shall not see sword or famine. 
13|  Our prophets became wind, and the word of the Lord was not in  them.  
14| Therefore thus saith the Lord  Almighty, Because ye have spoken this word, behold, I have made my words in thy  mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.  
15| Behold, I <i>will</i> bring upon you a  nation from far, O house of Israel, saith the Lord; a nation the sound of whose  language one shall not understand. 
16|  <i>They are</i> all mighty men: 
17|  and they shall devour your harvest, and your bread; and shall  devour your sons, and your daughters; and they shall devour your sheep, and your  calves, and devour your vineyards, and your fig-plantations, and your olive  yards: and they shall utterly destroy your strong cities, wherein ye trusted,  with the sword. 
18| And it shall come  to pass in those days, saith the Lord thy God, that I will not utterly destroy  you.  
19| And it shall come to pass, when ye  shall say, Wherefore has the Lord our God done all these things to us? that thou  shalt say to them, Because ye served strange gods in your land, so shall ye  serve strangers in a land that is not yours.
20| Proclaim these things to the house of  Jacob, and let them be heard in the house of Juda. 
21| Hear ye now these things, O foolish and senseless people;  who have eyes, and see not; and have ears, and hear not: 
 22| will ye not be afraid of me? saith the Lord; and will  ye not fear before me, who have set the sand for a bound to the sea, <i>as</i> a  perpetual ordinance, and it shall not pass it: yea, it shall rage, but not  prevail; and its waves shall roar, but not pass over it.  
23| But this people has a disobedient and  rebellious heart; and they have turned aside and gone back:  
24| and they have not said in their heart,  Let us fear now the Lord our God, who gives us the early and latter rain,  according to the season of the fulfillment of the ordinance of harvest, and has  preserved <i>it</i> for us. 
25| Your  transgressions have turned away these things, and your sins have removed good  things from you. 
26| For among my  people were found ungodly men; and they have set snares to destroy men, and have  caught <i>them</i>.  
27| As a snare which has been set is full  of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore have they grown great,  and become rich: 
28| and they have  transgressed <i>the rule of</i> judgment; they have not judged the cause of the  orphan, nor have they judged the cause of the widow. 
29| Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and  shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?  
30| Shocking and horrible deeds have been  done on the land; 
31| the prophets  utter unrighteous prophecies, and the priests have clapped their hands: and my  people has loved <i>to have it</i> thus: and what will ye do for the future. Chapter  6

1| Strengthen yourselves, ye children  of Benjamin, <i>to flee</i> out of the midst of Jerusalem, and sound an alarm  with the trumpet in Thecue, and set up a signal over Baethacharma: for evil  threatens from the north, and a great destruction is coming.  
2| And <i>thy</i> pride, O daughter of Sion,  shall be taken away. 
3| The shepherds  and their flocks shall come to her; and they shall pitch <i>their</i> tents  against her round about, and shall feed <i>their flocks</i> each with his hand.  
4| Prepare yourselves for war against  her; rise up, and let us go up against her at noon. Woe to us! for the day has  gone down, for the shadows of the day fail. 
5|  Rise, and let us go up against her by night, and destroy her  foundations.  
6| For thus saith the Lord, Hew down her  trees, array a numerous force against Jerusalem. O false city; <i>there is</i>  all oppression in her. 
7| As a  cistern cools water, so her wickedness cools her, ungodliness and misery shall  be heard in her, <i>as</i> continually before her.  
8| Thou shalt be chastened, O Jerusalem,  with pain and the scourge, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee a  desert land, which shall not be inhabited.
9| For thus saith the Lord, Glean, glean  thoroughly as a vine the remnant of Israel: turn back <i>your hands</i> as a  grape-gatherer to his basket. 
10| To  whom shall I speak, and testify, that he may hearken? behold, thine ears are  uncircumcised, and they shall not be able to hear: behold, the word of the Lord  is become to them a reproach, they will not at all desire it.  
11| And I allowed my wrath to come to  full, yet I kept <i>it</i> in, and did not utterly destroy them: I will pour it  out on the children without, and on the assembly of young men together: for man  and woman shall be taken together, the old man with him that is full of days. 
12| And their houses shall be turned  to others, <i>with</i> their fields and their wives together: for I will stretch  out my hand upon the inhabitants of this land, saith the Lord.  
13| For from the least of them even to  the greatest they have all committed iniquity; from the priest even to the false  prophet they have all wrought falsely. 
14|  And they healed the breach of my people <i>imperfectly</i>,  making light <i>of it</i>, and saying, Peace, peace, and where is peace?  
15| They were ashamed because they failed;  yet they were not ashamed as those who are <i>truly</i> ashamed, and they knew  not their own disgrace: therefore shall they <i>utterly</i> fall when they do  fall, and in the time of visitation shall they perish, said the Lord.   
16| Thus saith the Lord, Stand ye in the  ways, and see, and ask for the old paths of the Lord; and see what is the good  way, and walk in it, and ye shall find purification for your souls. But they  said, We will not walk <i>in them</i>. 
17|  I have set watchmen over you, <i>saying</i>, Hear ye the sound of  the trumpet. But they said, We will not hear <i>it</i>.
18| Therefore have the nations heard, and  they that feed their flocks. 
19|  Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evils upon this people, <i>even</i> the  fruit of their rebellions; for they have not heeded my words, and they have  rejected my law. 
20| Wherefore do ye  bring me frankincense from Saba, and cinnamon from a land afar off? your  whole-burnt-offerings are not acceptable, and your sacrifices have not been  pleasant to me. 
21| Therefore thus  saith the Lord, Behold, I <i>will</i> bring weakness upon this people, and the  fathers and sons shall be weak together; the neighbour and his friend shall  perish.  
22| Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a people  comes from the north, and nations shall be stirred up from the end of the earth. 
23| They shall lay hold on bow and  spear; <i>the people</i> is fierce, and will have no mercy; their voice is as  the roaring sea; they shall array themselves for war against thee as fire on  horses and chariots, O daughter of Sion.  
24| We have heard the report of them: our  hands are weakened: anguish has seized us, the pangs as of a woman in travail. 
25| Go not forth into the field, and  walk not in the ways; for the sword of the enemy lingers round about.  
26| O daughter of my people, gird thyself  with sackcloth: sprinkle <i>thyself</i> with ashes; make for thyself pitiable  lamentation, <i>as</i> the mourning for a beloved <i>son</i>: for misery will  come suddenly upon you.  
27| I have caused thee to be tried among  tried nations, and thou shalt know me when I have tried their way.  
28| <i>They are</i> all disobedient, walking  perversely: <i>they are</i> brass and iron; they are all corrupted.  
29| The bellows have failed from the fire,  the lead has failed: the silversmith works at his trade in vain; their  wickedness is not consumed. 
30| Call  ye them reprobate silver, because the Lord has rejected them. Chapter  7

1 2| Hear ye the word of the Lord, all  Judea. 
3| Thus saith the Lord God of  Israel, Correct your ways and your devices, and I will cause you to dwell in  this place. 
4| Trust not in  yourselves with lying words, for they shall not profit you at all, saying, It is  the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord.  
5| For if ye thoroughly correct your ways  and your practices, and do indeed execute judgment between a man and his  neighbour; 
6| and oppress not the  stranger, and the orphan, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this  place, and go not after strange gods to your hurt: 
7| then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land  which I gave to your fathers of old and for ever.  
8| But whereas ye have trusted in lying  words, whereby ye shall not be profited; 
9|  and ye murder, and commit adultery, and steal, and swear falsely,  and burn incense to Baal, and are gone after strange gods whom ye know not, 
10| so that it is evil with you; yet  have ye come, and stood before me in the house, whereon my name is called, and  ye have said, We have refrained from doing all these abominations.  
11| Is my house, whereon my name is called,  a den of robbers in your eyes? And, behold, I have seen <i>it</i>, saith the  Lord. 
12| For go ye to my place with  is in Selo, where I caused my name to dwell before, and see what I did to it  because of the wickedness of my people Israel.  
13| And now, because ye have done all  these deeds, and I spoke to you, but ye hearkened not to me; and I called you,  but ye answered not; 
14| therefore I  also will do to the house whereon my name is called, wherein ye trust, and to  the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I did to Selo.  
15| And I will cast you out of my sight, as  I cast away your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.
16| Therefore pray not thou for this  people, and intercede not for them to be pitied, yea, pray not, and approach me  not for them: for I will not hearken <i>unto thee</i>. 
17| Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Juda, and in  the streets of Jerusalem? 
18| Their  children gather wood, and their fathers kindle a fire, and their women knead  dough, to make cakes to the host of heaven; and they have poured out  drink-offerings to strange gods, that they might provoke me to anger.  
19| Do they provoke me to anger? saith the  Lord: do they not <i>provoke</i> themselves, that their faces may be ashamed?  
20| Therefore thus saith the Lord;  Behold, my anger and wrath shall be poured out upon this place, and upon the  men, and upon the cattle, and upon every tree of their field, and upon the  fruits of the land; and it shall burn, and not be quenched.
21| Thus saith the Lord, Gather your  whole-burnt-offerings with your meat-offerings, and eat flesh.  
22| For I spoke not to your fathers, and  commanded them not in the day wherein I brought them up out of the land of  Egypt, concerning whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifice: 
23| but I commanded them this thing, saying, Hear ye my voice,  and I will be to you a God, and ye shall be to me a people: and walk ye in all  my ways which I shall command you, that it may be well with you.  
24| But they hearkened not to me, and their  ear gave no heed, but they walked in the imaginations of their evil heart, and  went backward, and not forward; 
25|  from the day that their fathers went forth out of the land of Egypt, even until  this day. And I sent to you all my servants, the prophets, by day and early in  the morning: yea, I sent <i>them</i>, 
26|  but they hearkened not to me, and their ear gave no heed; and  they made their neck harder than their fathers.  
27| Therefore thou shalt speak this word  to them; 
28| This is the nation which  has not hearkened to the voice of the Lord, nor received correction: truth has  failed from their mouth.
29| Cut off thine hair, and cast it away,  and take up a lamentation on thy lips; for the Lord has reprobated and rejected  the generation that does these things. 
30|  For the children of Juda have wrought evil before me, saith the  Lord; they have set their abominations in the house on which my name is called,  to defile it. 
31| And they have built  the altar of Tapheth, which is in the valley of the son of Ennom, to burn their  sons and their daughters with fire; which I did not command them <i>to do</i>,  neither did I design it in my heart.  
32| Therefore, behold, the days come,  saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, The altar of Tapheth, and the  valley of the son of Ennom, but, The valley of the slain; and they shall bury in  Tapheth, for want of room. 
33| And  the dead bodies of this people shall be for food to the birds of the sky, and to  the wild beasts of the earth; and there shall be none to drive <i>them</i> away. 
34| And I will destroy out of the  cities of Juda, and the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of them that make merry,  and the voice of them that rejoice, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice  of the bride; for the whole land shall become a desolation. Chapter  8

1| At that time, saith the Lord, they  shall bring out the bones of the kings of Juda, and the bones of his princes,  and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of  the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves; 
2| and they shall spread them out to the sun, and the moon,  and to all the stars, and to all the host of heaven, which they have loved, and  which they have served, and after which they have walked, and to which they have  held, and which they have worshipped; they shall not be mourned for, neither  shall they be buried; but they shall be for an example on the face of the earth, 
3| because they chose death rather  than life, even to all the remnant that are left of that family, in every place  whither I shall drive them out.
4| For thus saith the Lord, Shall not he  that falls arise? or he that turns away, shall he not turn back again?  
5| Wherefore has this my people turned away  with a shameless revolting, and strengthened themselves in their willfulness,  and refused to return? 
6| Hearken, I  pray you, and hear: will they not speak thus, There is no man that repents of  his wickedness, saying, What have I done? the runner has failed from his course,  as a tired horse in his neighing. 
7|  Yea, the stork in the heaven knows her time, <i>also</i> the turtle-dove and  wild swallow; the sparrows observe the times of their coming in; but this my  people knows not the judgments of the Lord.  
8| How will ye say, We are wise, and the  law of the Lord is with us? In vain have the scribes used a false pen.  
9| The wise men are ashamed, and alarmed,  and taken; because they have rejected the word of the Lord; what wisdom is there  in them? 
10| Therefore will I give  their wives to others, and their fields to <i>new</i> inheritors; and they shall  gather their fruits, saith the Lord. 
11 12 13|  There are no grapes on the vines, and there are no figs on the  fig-trees, and the leaves have fallen off.  
14| Why do we sit still? assemble  yourselves, and let us enter into the strong cities, and let us be cast out  there: for God has cast us out, and made us drink water of gall, because we have  sinned before him. 
15| We assembled  for peace, but there was no prosperity; for a time of healing, but behold  anxiety.  
16| We shall hear the neighing of his  swift horses out of Dan: the whole land quaked at the sound of the neighing of  his horses; and he shall come, and devour the land and the fullness of it; the  city, and them that dwell in it. 
17|  For, behold, I send forth against you deadly serpents, which cannot be charmed,  and they shall bite you 
18| mortally  with the pain of your distressed heart.  
19| Behold, <i>there is</i> a sound of  the cry of the daughter of my people from a land afar off: Is not the Lord in  Sion? is there not a king there? because they have provoked me with their graven <i>images</i>, and with strange vanities. 
20|  The summer is gone, the harvest is past, and we are not saved.  
21| For the breach of the daughter of my  people I have been saddened: in my perplexity pangs have seized upon me as of a  woman in travail. 
22| And is there no  balm in Galaad, or is there no physician there? why has not the healing of the  daughter of my people taken place? Chapter  9  

#9
1| Who will give water to my head, and  a fountain of tears to my eyes? then would I weep for this my people day and  night, <i>even</i> for the slain of the daughter of my people.  
2| Who would give me a most distant lodge  in the wilderness, that I might leave my people, and depart from them? for they  all commit adultery, an assembly of treacherous men. 
3| And they have bent their tongue like a bow: falsehood and  not faithfulness has prevailed upon the earth; for they have gone on from evil  to evil, and have not known me, saith the Lord. 
4|  Beware ye each of his neighbour, and trust ye not in your  brethren: for every one will surely supplant, and every friend will walk  craftily. 
5| Every one will mock his  friend; they will not speak truth: their tongue has learned to speak falsehoods;  they have committed iniquity, they ceased not, so as to return.  
6| <i>There is</i> usury upon usury, and  deceit upon deceit: they would not know me, saith the Lord.  
7| Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold,  I will try them with fire, and prove them; for I will do <i>thus</i> because of  the wickedness of the daughter of my people. 
8|  Their tongue is a wounding arrow; the words of their mouth are  deceitful: <i>one</i> speaks peaceably to his neighbour, but in himself retains  enmity. 
9| Shall I not visit for  these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a people  as this? 
10| Take up a lamentation  for the mountains, and a mournful dirge for the paths of the wilderness, for  they are desolate for want of men; they heard not the sound of life from the  birds of the sky, nor the cattle: they were amazed, they are gone.  
11| And I will remove the inhabitants of  Jerusalem, and make it a dwelling-place of dragons; and I will utterly waste the  cities of Juda, so that they shall not be inhabited.
12| Who is the wise man, that he may  understand this? and he that has the word of the mouth of the Lord <i>addressed</i>  to him, let him tell you wherefore the land has been destroyed, has been ravaged  by fire like a desert, so that no one passes through it. 
 13| And the Lord said to me, Because they have forsaken my  law, which I set before them, and have not hearkened to my voice;  
14| but went after the lusts of their evil  heart, and after the idols which their fathers taught them <i>to worship</i>: 
15| therefore thus saith the Lord God  of Israel, Behold, I will feed them with trouble and will cause them to drink  water of gall: 
16| and I will scatter  them among the nations, to them whom neither they nor their fathers knew; and I  will send a sword upon them, until I have consumed them with it.  
17| Thus saith the Lord, Call ye the  mourning women, and let them come; and send to the wise women, and let them  utter their voice; 
18| and let them  take up a lamentation for you, and let your eyes pour down tears, and your  eyelids drop water. 
19| For a voice  of lamentation has been heard in Sion, How are we become wretched! we are  greatly ashamed, for we have forsaken the land, and have abandoned our  tabernacles! 
20| Hear now, ye women,  the word of God, and let your ears receive the words of his mouth, and teach  your daughters lamentation, and <i>every</i> woman her neighbour a dirge.  
21| For death has come up through your  windows, it has entered into our land, to destroy the infants without, and the  young men from the streets. 
22| And  the carcases of the men shall be for an example on the face of the field of your  land, like grass after the mower, and there shall be none to gather <i>them</i>.
23| Thus saith the Lord, Let not the wise  man boast in his wisdom, and let not the strong man boast in his strength, and  let not the rich man boast in his wealth; 
24|  but let him that boasts boast in this, the understanding and  knowing that I am the Lord that exercise mercy, and judgment, and righteousness,  upon the earth; for in these things is my pleasure, saith the Lord.  
25| Behold, the days come, saith the  Lord, when I will visit upon all the circumcised their uncircumcision;  
26| on Egypt, and on Idumea, and on Edom,  and on the children of Ammon, and on the children of Moab, and on every one that  shaves his face round about, <i>even</i> them that dwell in the wilderness; for  all the Gentiles are uncircumcised in flesh, and all the house of Israel are  uncircumcised <i>in</i> their hearts. Chapter  10  

#10
1| Hear ye the word of the Lord, which  he has spoken to you, O house of Israel.  
2| Thus saith the Lord, Learn ye not the  ways of the heathen, and be not alarmed at the signs of the sky; for they are  alarmed at them, <i>falling</i> on their faces. 
3|  For the customs of the nations are vain; it is a tree cut out of  the forest, the work of the carpenter, or a molten image. 
 4| <i>They are</i> beautified with silver and gold, they  fix them with hammers and nails; 
5|  they will set them up that they may not move; it is wrought silver, they will  not walk, it is forged silver They must certainly be borne, for they cannot ride <i>of themselves</i>. Fear them not; for they cannot do any evil, and there is  no good in them.
|  
11| Thus shall ye say to them, Let the  gods which have not made heaven and earth perish from off the earth, and from  under this sky. 
12| It is the Lord  that made the earth by his strength, who set up the world by his wisdom, and by  his understanding stretched out the sky, 
13|  and set abundance of waters in the sky, and brought up clouds  from the ends of the earth; he made lightnings for the rain, and brought forth  light out of his treasures. 
14| Every  man is deprived of knowledge, every goldsmith is confounded because of his  graven images; for he has cast false gods, there is no breath in them.  
15| They are vain works, wrought in mockery;  in the time of their visitation they shall perish. 
16| Such is not the portion of Jacob; for he that formed all  things, he is his inheritance; the Lord is his name.
17| He has gathered thy substance from  without the lodged in choice <i>vessels</i>. 
18|  For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I <i>will</i> overthrow the  inhabitants of this land with affliction, that thy plague may be discovered.  
19| Alas for thy ruin! thy plague is  grievous: and I said, Surely this is thy wound, and it has overtaken thee. 
20| Thy tabernacle is in a ruinous  state, it has perished; and all thy curtains have been torn asunder: my children  and my cattle are no more: there is no more any place for my tabernacle, <i>nor</i>  place for my curtains. 
21| For the  shepherds have become foolish, and have not sought the Lord; therefore the whole  pasture has failed, and <i>the sheep</i> have been scattered.  
22| Behold, there comes a sound of a noise,  and a great earthquake from the land of the north, to make the cities of Juda a  desolation, and a resting-place for ostriches.  
23| I know, O Lord, that man’s way is not  his own; neither shall a man go, and direct his going. 
24| Chasten us, O Lord, but with judgment; and not in wrath,  lest thou make us few. 
25| Pour out  thy wrath upon the nations that have not known thee, and upon the families that  have not called upon thy name: for they have devoured Jacob, and consumed him,  and have made his pasture desolate. Chapter  11  

#11
1| The word that came to Jeremias from  the Lord, saying,  
2| Hear ye the words of this covenant,  and thou shalt speak to the men of Juda, and to the dwellers in Jerusalem; 
3| and thou shalt say to them, Thus  saith the Lord God of Israel, Cursed is the man, who shall not hearken to the  words of this covenant, 
4| which I  commanded your fathers, in the day wherein I brought them up out of the land of  Egypt, out of the iron furnace, saying, Hearken to my voice, and do all things  that I shall command you; so shall ye be to me a people, and I will be to you a  God; 
5| that I may confirm mine oath,  which I sware to your fathers, to give them a land flowing <i>with</i> milk and  honey, as <i>it is</i> this day. Then I answered and said, So be it, O Lord. 
6| And the Lord said to me, Read  these words in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear  ye the words of this covenant, and do them. 
7 8|  But they did <i>them</i> not.  
9| And the Lord said to me, A conspiracy  is found among the men of Juda, and among the dwellers in Jerusalem.  
10| They are turned <i>aside</i> to the  iniquities of their fathers that were of old, who would not hearken to my words:  and, behold, they go after strange gods, to serve them: and the house of Israel  and the house of Juda have broken my covenant, which I made with their fathers.
11| Therefore thus saith the Lord,  Behold, I bring evils upon this people, out of which they shall not be able to  come forth; and they shall presently cry to me, but I will not hearken to them. 
12| And the cities of Juda and the  dwellers in Jerusalem shall go, and cry to the gods to whom they burn incense;  which shall not deliver them in the time of their troubles.  
13| For according to the number of thy  cities were thy gods, O Juda; and according to the number of the streets of  Jerusalem have ye set up altars to burn incense to Baal.  
14| And thou, pray not for this people,  and intercede not for them in supplication and prayer: for I will not hear in  the day in which they call upon me, in the day of their affliction.  
15| Why has <i>my</i> beloved wrought  abomination in my house? will prayers and holy offerings take away thy  wickedness from thee, or shalt thou escape by these things?  
16| The Lord called thy name a fair olive  tree, of a goodly shade in appearance, at the noise of its being lopped, fire  was kindled against it; great is the affliction <i>coming</i> upon thee: her  branches are become good for nothing. 
17|  And the Lord that planted thee has pronounced evils against thee,  because of the iniquity of the house of Israel and the house of Juda, whatsoever  they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger by burning incense to  Baal.
18| O Lord, teach me, and I shall know:  then I saw their practices. 
19| But I  as an innocent lamb led to the slaughter, knew not: against me they devised an  evil device, saying, Come and let us put wood into his bread, and let us utterly  destroy him from off the land of the living, and let his name not be remembered  any more. 
20| O Lord, that judgest  righteously, trying the reins and hearts, let me see thy vengeance <i>taken</i>  upon them, for to thee I have declared my cause.  
21| Therefore thus saith the Lord  concerning the men of Anathoth, that seek my life, that say, Thou shalt not  prophesy at all in the name of the Lord, but if thou dost, thou shalt die by our  hands: 
22| behold, I will visit them:  their young men shall die by the sword; and their sons and their daughters shall  die of famine: 
23| and there shall be  no remnant <i>left</i> of them; for I will bring evil upon the dwellers in  Anathoth, in the year of their visitation. Chapter  12  

#12
1| Righteous art thou, O Lord, that I  may make my defence to thee, yea, I will speak to thee <i>of</i> judgments. Why <i>is it</i> that the way of ungodly <i>men</i> prospers? <i>that</i> all that  deal very treacherously are flourishing? 
2|  Thou hast planted them, and they have taken root; they have  begotten children, and become fruitful; thou art near to their mouth, and far  from their reins. 
3| But thou, Lord,  knowest me; thou hast proved my heart before thee; purify them for the day of  their slaughter. 
4| How long shall  the land mourn, and the grass of the field wither, for the wickedness of them,  that dwell in it? the beasts and birds are utterly destroyed; because <i>the  people</i> said, God shall not see our ways.  
5| Thy feet run, and they cause thee to  faint; how wilt thou prepare <i>to ride</i> upon horses? and thou hast been  confident in the land of thy peace? how wilt thou do in the roaring of Jordan? 
6| For even thy brethren and the  house of thy father, even these have dealt treacherously with thee; and they  have cried out, they are gathered together in pursuit of thee; trust not thou in  them, though they shall speak fair <i>words</i> to thee.
7| I have forsaken mine house, I have  left mine heritage; I have given my beloved one into the hands of her enemies. 
8| My inheritance has become to me as  a lion in a forest; she has uttered her voice against me; therefore have I hated  her. 
9| Is not my inheritance to me a  hyaena’s cave, or a cave round about her? Go ye, gather together all the wild  beasts of the field, and let them come to devour her.  
10| Many shepherds have destroyed my  vineyard, they have defiled my portion, they have made my desirable portion a  trackless wilderness; 
11| it is made  a complete ruin: for my sake the whole land has been utterly ruined, because  there is none that lays <i>the matter</i> to heart. 
12| The ravagers are come to every passage in the wilderness:  for the sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other: no  flesh has any peace. 
13| Sow wheat,  and reap thorns; their portions shall not profit them: be ashamed of your  boasting, because of reproach before the Lord.
14| For thus saith the Lord, concerning  all the evil neighbours that touch mine inheritance, which I have divided to my  people Israel; Behold, I <i>will</i> draw them away from their land, and I will  cast out Juda from the midst of them.  
15| And it shall come to pass, after I  have cast them out, <i>that</i> I will return, and have mercy upon them, and  will cause them to dwell every one in his inheritance, and every one in his  land. 
16| And it shall be, if they  will indeed learn the way of my people, to swear by my name, <i>saying</i>, The  Lord lives; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall <i>that nation</i>  be built in the midst of my people. 
17|  But if they will not return, then will I cut off that nation with  utter ruin and destruction. Chapter  13 

#13
1| Thus saith the Lord, Go and procure  for thyself a linen girdle, and put it about thy loins, and let it not be put in  water. 
2| So I procured the girdle  according to the word of the Lord, and put it about my loins.  
3| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying, 
4| Take the girdle that is  upon thy loins, and arise, and go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole  of the rock. 
5| So I went, and hid it  by the Euphrates, as the Lord commanded me. 
6|  And it came to pass after many days, that the Lord said to me,  Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take thence the girdle, which I commanded thee  to hide there. 
7| So I went to the  river Euphrates, and dug, and took the girdle out of the place where I <i>had</i>  buried it: and, behold, it was rotten, utterly good for nothing.  
8| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying, Thus saith the Lord, 
9| Thus  will I mar the pride of Juda, and the pride of Jerusalem; 
 10| <i>even</i> this great pride <i>of the men</i> that  will not hearken to my words, and have gone after strange gods, to serve them,  and to worship them: and they shall be as this girdle, which can be used for  nothing. 
11| For as a girdle cleaves  about the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to myself the house of  Israel, and the whole house of Juda; that they might be to me a famous people,  and a praise, and a glory: but they did not hearken to me.
12| And thou shalt say to this people,  Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and it shall come to pass, if they shall  say to thee, Shall we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with  wine? that thou shalt say to them, 
13|  Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I <i>will</i> fill the inhabitants  of this land, and their kings the sons of David that sit upon their throne, and  the priests, and the prophets, and Juda and all the dwellers in Jerusalem, with  strong drink. 
14| And I will scatter  them a man and his brother, and their fathers and their sons together: I will  not have compassion, saith the Lord, and I will not spare, neither will I pity <i>to save them</i> from destruction.  
15| Hear ye, and give ear, and be not  proud: for the Lord has spoken. 
16|  Give glory to the Lord your God, before he cause darkness, and before your feet  stumble on the dark mountains, and ye shall wait for light, and behold the  shadow of death, and they shall be brought into darkness. 
 17| But if ye will not hearken, your soul shall weep in  secret because of pride, and your eyes shall pour down tears, because the Lord’s  flock is sorely bruised.  
18| Say ye to the king and the princes,  Humble yourselves, and sit down; for your crown of glory is removed from your  head. 
19| The cities toward the south  were shut, and there was none to open <i>them</i>: Juda is removed <i>into  captivity,</i>they have suffered a complete removal. 
20| Lift up thine eyes, O Jerusalem, and behold them that come  from the north; where is the flock that was given thee, the sheep of thy glory? 
21| What wilt thou say when they  shall visit thee, for thou didst teach them lessons for rule against thyself;  shall not pangs seize thee as a woman in travail? 
22| And if thou shouldest say in thine heart, Wherefore have  these things happened to me? Because of the abundance of thine iniquity have thy  skirts been discovered, that thine heels might be exposed.  
23| If the Ethiopian shall change his  skin, or the leopardess her spots, then shall ye be able to do good, having  learnt evil. 
24| So I scattered them  as sticks carried by the wind into the wilderness. 
25| Thus is thy lot, and the reward of your disobedience to  me, saith the Lord; as thou didst forget me, and trust in lies,  
26| I also will expose thy skirts upon thy  face, and thy shame shall be seen; 
27|  thine adultery also, and thy neighing, and the looseness of thy  fornication: on the hills and in the fields I have seen thine abominations. Woe  to thee, O Jerusalem, for thou hast not been purified so as to follow me; how  long yet <i>shall it be</i>? Chapter  14  

#14
1| AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO  JEREMIAS CONCERNING THE DROUGHT.  
2| Judea has mourned, and her gates are  emptied, and are darkened upon the earth; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. 
3| And her nobles have sent their  little ones to the water: they came to the wells, and found no water: and  brought back their vessels empty. 
4|  And the labours of the land failed, because there was no rain: the husbandmen  were ashamed, they covered their heads. 
5|  And hinds calved in the field, and forsook <i>it</i>, because  there was no grass. 
6| The wild asses  stood by the forests, and snuffed up the wind; their eyes failed, because there  was no grass.  
7| Our sins have risen up against us: O  Lord, do thou for us for thine own sake; for our sins are many before thee; for  we have sinned against thee. 
8| O  Lord, <i>thou art</i> the hope of Israel, and deliverest <i>us</i> in time of  troubles; why art thou become as a sojourner upon the land, or as one born in  the land, yet turning aside for a resting-place? 
9|  Wilt thou be as a man asleep, or as a <i>strong</i> man that  cannot save? yet thou art among us, O Lord, and thy name is called upon us;  forget us not.
10| Thus saith the Lord to this people,  They have loved to wander, and they have not spared, therefore God has not  prospered them; now will he remember their iniquity. 
11| And the Lord said to me, Pray not for this people for <i> their</i> good: 
12| for though they  fast, I will not hear their supplication; and though they offer  whole-burnt-offerings and sacrifices, I will take no pleasure in them: for I  will consume them with sword, and with famine, and with pestilence.  
13| And I said, O <i>ever</i> living  Lord! behold, their prophets prophesy, and say, Ye shall not see a sword, nor  shall famine be among you; for I will give truth and peace on the land, and in  this place.  
14| Then the Lord said to me, The  prophets prophesy lies in my name: I sent them not, and I commanded them not,  and I spoke not to them: for they prophesy to you false visions, and  divinations, and auguries, and devices of their own heart.  
15| Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning  the prophets that prophesy lies in my name, and I sent them not, who say, Sword  and famine shall not be upon this land; they shall die by a grievous death, and  the prophets shall be consumed by famine. 
16|  And the people to whom they prophesy, they also shall be cast out  in the streets of Jerusalem, because of the sword and famine; and there shall be  none to bury them: their wives also, and their sons, and their daughters <i> shall die thus</i>; and I will pour out their wickedness upon them.
17| And thou shalt speak this word to  them; Let your eyes shed tears day and night, and let them not cease: for the  daughter of my people has been sorely bruised, and her plague is very grievous. 
18| If I go forth into the plain,  then behold the slain by the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold  the distress of famine! for priest and prophet have gone to a land which they  knew not.  
19| Hast thou utterly rejected Juda? and  has thy soul departed from Sion? wherefore has thou smitten us, and there is no  healing for us? we waited for peace, but there was no prosperity; for a time of  healing, and behold trouble! 
20| We  know, O Lord, our sins, <i>and</i> the iniquities of our fathers: for we have  sinned before thee. 
21| Refrain for  thy name’s sake, destroy not the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy  covenant with us. 
22| Is there any  one among the idols of the Gentiles that can give rain? and will the sky yield  his fulness <i>at their bidding</i>? Art not thou he? we will even wait on thee,  O Lord: for thou hast made all these things. Chapter  15

1| And the Lord said to me, Though  Moses and Samuel stood before my face, my soul could not be toward them: dismiss  this people, and let them go forth. 
2|  And it shall be, if they say to thee, Whither shall we go forth?  then thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the Lord; As many as are for death, to  death; and as many as are for famine, to famine; and as many as are for the  sword, to the sword; and as many as are for captivity, to captivity.  
3| And I will punish them with four kinds <i> of death</i>, saith the Lord, the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the  wild beasts of the earth, and the birds of the sky to devour and destroy.  
4| And I will deliver them up for distress  to all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasses son of Ezekias king of  Juda, for all that he did in Jerusalem.  
5| Who will spare thee, O Jerusalem? and  who will fear for thee? or who will turn back <i>to</i> <i>ask</i> for thy  welfare? 
6| Thou hast turned away  from me, saith the Lord, thou wilt go back: therefore I will stretch out my  hand, and will destroy thee, and will no more spare them. 
 7| And I will completely scatter them; in the gates of my  people they are bereaved of children: they have destroyed my people because of  their iniquities.  
8| Their widows have been multiplied more  than the sand of the sea: I have brought young men against the mother, <i>even</i>  distress at noon-day: I have suddenly cast upon her trembling and anxiety. 
9| She that bore seven is spent; her  soul has fainted under trouble; her sun is gone down while it is yet noon; she  is ashamed and disgraced: I will give the remnant of them to the sword before  their enemies.
10| Woe is me, <i>my</i> mother! thou  hast born me as some man of strife, and at variance with the whole earth; I have  not helped <i>others</i>, nor has any one helped me; my strength has failed  among them that curse me. 
11| Be it  so, Lord, in their prosperity; surely I stood before thee in the time of their  calamities, and in the time of their affliction, for <i>their</i> good against  the enemy. 
12| Will iron be known?  whereas thy strength is a brazen covering. 
13|  Yea, I will give thy treasures for a spoil as a recompence,  because of all thy sins and <i>that</i> in all thy borders.  
14| And I will enslave thee to thine enemies  round about, in a land which thou hast not known; for a fire has been kindled  out of my wrath; it shall burn upon you.
15| O Lord, remember me, and visit me,  and vindicate me before them that persecute me; do not bear long with them; know  how I have met with reproach for thy sake, from those who set at nought thy  words; 
16| consume them; and thy word  shall be to me for the joy and gladness of my heart: for thy name has been  called upon me, O Lord Almighty. 
17|  I have not sat in the assembly of them as they mocked, but I feared because of  thy power: I sat alone, for I was filled with bitterness.  
18| Why do they that grieve me prevail  against me? my wound is severe; whence shall I be healed? it is indeed become to  me as deceitful water, that has no faithfulness.  
19| Therefore thus saith the Lord, If  thou wilt return, then will I restore thee, and thou shalt stand before my face:  and if thou wilt bring forth the precious from the worthless, thou shalt be as  my mouth: and they shall return to thee; but thou shalt not return to them. 
20| And I will make thee to this  people as a strong brazen wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they  shall by no means prevail against thee; 
21|  for I am with thee to save thee, and to deliver thee out of the  hand of wicked <i>men</i>; and I will ransom thee out of the hand of pestilent <i>men</i>. Chapter  16

1| And thou shalt not take a wife,  saith the Lord God of Israel: 
2| and  there shall be no son born to thee, nor daughter in this place.  
3| For thus saith the Lord concerning the  sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning  their mothers that have born them, and concerning their fathers that have  begotten them in this land; 
4| They  shall die of grievous death; they shall not be lamented, nor buried; they shall  be for an example on the face of the earth; and they shall be for the wild  beasts of the land, and for the birds of the sky: they shall fall by the sword,  and shall be consumed with famine.  
5| Thus saith the Lord, Enter not into  their mourning feast, and go not to lament, and mourn not for them: for I have  removed my peace from this people. 
6|  They shall not bewail them, nor make cuttings for them, and they  shall not shave themselves <i>for them</i>: 
7|  and there shall be no bread broken in mourning for them for  consolation over the dead: they shall not give one to drink a cup for  consolation over his father or his mother.  
8| Thou shalt not enter into the  banquet-house, to sit with them to eat and to drink. 
9| For thus saith the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I <i>will</i>  make to cease out of this place before your eyes, and in your days, the voice of  joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of  the bride.
10| And it shall come to pass, when thou  shalt report to this people all these words, and they shall say to thee,  Wherefore has the Lord pronounced against us all these evils? what is our  unrighteousness? and what is our sin which we have sinned before the Lord our  God? 
11| Then thou shalt say to them,  Because your fathers forsook me, saith the Lord, and went after strange gods and  served them, and worshipped them, and forsook me, and kept not my law;  
12| (and ye sinned worse than your fathers;  for, behold, ye walk every one after the lusts of your own evil heart, so as not  to hearken to me); 
13| therefore I  will cast you off from this good land into a land which neither ye nor your  fathers have known; and ye shall serve their other gods, who shall have no mercy  upon you.
14| Therefore, behold, the days come,  saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, The Lord lives, that brought up the  children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 
15|  but, The Lord lives, who brought up the house of Israel from the  land of the north, and from all countries whither they were thrust out: and I  will restore them to their own land, which I gave to their fathers.  
16| Behold, I <i>will</i> send many  fishers, saith the Lord, and they shall fish them; and afterward I will send  many hunters, and they shall hunt them upon every mountain, and upon every hill,  and out of the holes of the rocks. 
17|  For mine eyes are upon all their ways; and their iniquities have  not been hidden from mine eyes. 
18|  And I will recompense their mischiefs doubly, and their sins, whereby they have  profaned my land with the carcases of their abominations, and with their  iniquities, whereby they have trespassed against mine inheritance.  
19| O Lord, thou art my strength, and  mine help, and my refuge in days of evil: to thee the Gentiles shall come from  the end of the earth, and shall say, How vain <i>were the</i> idols <i>which</i>  our fathers procured to themselves, and there is no help in them.  
20| Will a man make gods for himself,  whereas these are no gods? 
21|  Therefore, behold, I will at this time manifest my hand to them, and will make  known to them my power; and they shall know that my name is the Lord. Chapter  17

1| Cursed is the man who trusts in  man, and will lean his arm of flesh upon him, while his heart departs from the  Lord. 
6| And he shall be as the wild  tamarisk in the desert: he shall not see when good comes; but he shall dwell in  barren <i>places</i>, and in the wilderness, in a salt land which is not  inhabited. 
7| But blessed is the man  who trusts in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord shall be. 
 8| And he shall be as a thriving tree by the waters, and he  shall cast forth his root toward a moist place: he shall not fear when heat  comes, and there shall be upon him shady branches: he shall not fear in a year  of drought, and he shall not fail to bear fruit. &nbsp;
9| The heart is  deep beyond all things, and it is the man, and who can know him?  
10| I the Lord try the hearts, and prove the  reins, to give to every one according to his ways, and according to the fruits  of his devices.  
11| The partridge utters her voice, she  gathers <i>eggs</i> which she did not lay; <i>so is a man</i> gaining his wealth  unjustly; in the midst of his days <i>his riches</i> shall leave him, and at his  latter end he will be a fool.
12| An exalted throne of glory is our  sanctuary. 
13| O Lord, the hope of  Israel, let all that have left thee be ashamed, let them that have revolted be  written on the earth, because they have forsaken the fountain of life, the Lord.  
14| Heal me, O Lord, and I shall be  healed; save me, and I shall be saved; for thou art my boast.  
15| Behold, they say to me, Where is the  word of the Lord? let it come. 
16|  But I have not been weary of following thee, nor have I desired the day of man;  thou knowest; the <i>words</i> that proceed out of my lips are before thy face. 
17| Be not to me a stranger, <i>but</i>  spare me in the evil day. 
18| Let  them that persecute me be ashamed, but let me not be ashamed: let them be  alarmed, but let me not be alarmed: bring upon them the evil day, crush them  with double destruction.
19| Thus saith the Lord; Go and stand in  the gates of the children of thy people, by which the kings of Juda enter, and  by which they go out, and in all the gates of Jerusalem: 
 20| and thou shalt say to them, Hear the word of the Lord,  ye kings of Juda, and all Judea, and all Jerusalem, <i>all</i> who go in at  these gates:  
21| thus saith the Lord; Take heed to  your souls, and take up no burdens on the sabbath-day, and go not forth <i> through</i> the gates of Jerusalem; 
22|  and carry forth no burdens out of your houses on the sabbath-day,  and ye shall do no work: sanctify the sabbath-day, as I commanded your fathers. 
23| But they hearkened not, and  inclined not their ear, but stiffened their neck more than their fathers <i>did</i>,  so as not to hear me, and not to receive correction. 
24| And it shall come to pass, if ye will hearken to me, saith  the Lord, to carry in no burdens through the gates of this city on the  sabbath-day, and to sanctify the sabbath-day, so as to do no work <i>upon it</i>, 
25| that there shall enter through  the gates of this city kings and princes sitting on the throne of David, and  riding on their chariots and horses, they, and their princes, the men of Juda,  and the dwellers in Jerusalem: and this city shall be inhabited for ever.  
26| And <i>men</i> shall come out of the  cities of Juda, and from round about Jerusalem, and out of the land of Benjamin,  and out of the plain country, and from the hill country, and from the south <i> country</i>, bringing whole-burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and incense, and  manna, and frankincense, bringing praise to the house of the Lord.  
27| But it shall come to pass, if ye will  not hearken to me to sanctify the sabbath-day, to bear no burdens, nor go in <i> with them by</i> the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath-day; then will I kindle a  fire in the gates thereof, and it shall devour the streets of Jerusalem, and  shall not be quenched. Chapter  18

1| The word that came from the Lord to 
2| Jeremias, saying, Arise, and go  down to the potter’s house, and there thou shalt hear my words.  
3| So I went down to the potter’s house, and  behold, he was making a vessel on the stones. 
4|  And the vessel which he was making with his hands fell: so he  made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to him to make <i>it</i>.  
5| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,  
6| Shall I not be able, O house of  Israel, to do to you as this potter? behold, as the clay of the potter are ye in  my hands. 
7| <i>If</i> I shall  pronounce a decree upon a nation, or upon a kingdom, to cut them off, and to  destroy <i>them</i>; 
8| and that  nation turn from all their sins, then will I repent of the evils which I  purposed to do to them. 
9| And <i>if</i>  I shall pronounce a decree upon a nation and kingdom, to rebuild and to plant <i> it</i>; 
10| and they do evil before  me, so as not to hearken to my voice, then will I repent of the good which I  spoke of, to do it to them.
11| And now say to the men of Juda, and  to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Behold, I prepare evils against you, and devise  a device against you: let every one turn now from his evil way, and amend your  practices. 
12| And they said, We will  quit ourselves like men, for we will pursue our perverse ways, and we will  perform each the lusts of his evil heart.  
13| Therefore thus saith the Lord;  Enquire now among the nations, who has heard such very horrible things as the  virgin of Israel has done? 
14| Will  fertilising streams fail <i>to flow</i> from a rock, or snow <i>fail</i> from  Libanus? will water violently impelled by the wind turn aside?  
15| For my people have forgotten me, they  have offered incense in vain, and they fail in their ways, <i>leaving</i> the  ancient tracks, to enter upon impassable paths; 
16|  to make their land a desolation, and a perpetual hissing; all  that go through it shall be amazed, and shall shake their heads.  
17| I will scatter them before their enemies  like an east wind; I will shew them the day of their destruction.
18| Then they said, Come, and let us  devise a device against Jeremias; for the law shall not perish from the priest,  nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite  him with the tongue, and we will hear all his words.  
19| Hear me, O Lord, and hear the voice  of my pleading. 
20| Forasmuch as evil  is rewarded for good; for they have spoken words against my soul, and they have  hidden the punishment they <i>meant</i> for me; remember that I stood before thy  face, to speak good for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.  
21| Therefore do thou deliver their sons to  famine, and gather them to the power of the sword: let their women be childless  and widows; and let their men be cut off by death, and their young men fall by  the sword in war. 
22| Let there be a  cry in their houses: thou shalt bring upon them robbers suddenly: for they have  formed a plan to take me, and have hidden snares for me.  
23| And thou, Lord, knowest all their  deadly counsel against me: account not their iniquities guiltless, and blot not  out their sins from before thee: let their weakness come before thee; deal with  them in the time of thy wrath. Chapter  19

1| Then said the Lord to me, Go and  get an earthen bottle, the work of the potter, and thou shalt bring <i>some</i>  of the elders of the people, and of the priests; 
2|  and thou shalt go forth to the burial-place of the sons of their  children, which is at the entrance of the gate of Charsith; and do thou read  there all these words which I shall speak to thee: 
3| and thou shalt say to them,  Hear ye the word of the Lord, ye kings of Juda, and men of  Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem, and they that enter in by these gates; thus  saith the Lord God of Israel; Behold, I <i>will</i> bring evil upon this place,  so that the ears of every one that hears it shall tingle. 
 4| Because they forsook me, and profaned this place, and  burnt incense in it to strange gods, which they and their fathers knew not; and  the kings of Juda have filled this place with innocent blood,  
5| and built high places for Baal, to burn  their children in the fire, which things I commanded not, neither did I design <i>them</i> in my heart:  
6| Therefore, behold, the days come,  saith the Lord, when this place shall no more be called, The fall and  burial-place of the son of Ennom, but, The burial-place of slaughter.  
7| And I will destroy the counsel of Juda  and the counsel of Jerusalem in this place; and I will cast them down with the  sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and  I will give their dead bodies for food to the birds of the sky and to the wild  beasts of the earth. 
8| And I will  bring this city to desolation and <i>make it</i> a hissing; every one that  passes by it shall scowl, and hiss because of all her plague.  
9| And they shall eat the flesh of their  sons, and the flesh of their daughters; and they shall eat every one the flesh  of his neighbour in the blockade, and in the siege wherewith their enemies shall  besiege them.
10| And thou shalt break the bottle in  the sight of the men that go forth with thee, 
11|  and thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord, Thus will I break in  pieces this people, and this city, even as an earthen vessel is broken in pieces  which cannot be mended again. 
12|  Thus will I do, saith the Lord, to this place, and to the inhabitants of it,  that this city may be given up, as one that is falling to ruin.  
13| And the houses of Jerusalem, and the  houses of the kings of Juda shall be as a ruinous place, because of their  uncleannesses in all the houses, wherein they burnt incense upon their roofs to  all the host of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to strange gods.  
14| And Jeremias came from <i>the place</i>  of the Fall, whither the Lord had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the  court of the Lord’s house: and said to all the people, Thus saith the Lord; 
15| Behold I bring upon this city,  and upon all the cities belonging to it, and upon the villages of it, all the  evils which I have spoken against it, because they have hardened their neck, <i> that they might not</i> hearken to my commands. Chapter  20

1| Now Paschor the son of Emmer, the  priest, who also had been appointed chief of the house of the Lord, heard  Jeremias prophesying these words. 
2|  And he smote him, and cast him into the dungeon which was by the gate of the  upper house that was set apart, which was by the house of the Lord.  
3| And Paschor brought Jeremias out of  the dungeon: and Jeremias said to him, <i>The Lord</i> has not called thy name  Paschor, but Exile. 
4| For thus saith  the Lord, Behold, I <i>will</i> give thee up to captivity with all thy friends:  and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall see <i> it</i>: and I will give thee and all Juda into the hands of the king of Babylon,  and they shall carry them captives, and cut them in pieces with swords.  
5| And I will give all the strength of this  city, and all the labours of it, and all the treasures of the king of Juda, into  the hands of his enemies, and they shall bring them to Babylon.  
6| And thou and all the dwellers in thine  house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt die in Babylon, and there thou and  all thy friends shall be buried, to whom thou hast prophesied lies.
7| Thou hast deceived me, O Lord, and I  have been deceived: thou hast been strong, and has prevailed: I am become a  laughing-stock, I am continually mocked every day. 
8| For I will laugh with my bitter speech, I will call upon  rebellion and misery: for the word of the Lord is become a reproach to me and a  mockery all my days. 
9| Then I said,  I will by no means name the name of the Lord, and I will no more at all speak in  his name. But it was a burning fire flaming in my bones, and I am utterly  weakened on all sides, and cannot bear <i>up</i>. 
10| For I have heard the reproach of many gathering round, <i> saying</i>, Conspire ye, and let us conspire together against him, <i>even</i>  all his friends: watch his intentions, if perhaps he shall be deceived, and we  shall prevail against him, and we shall be avenged on him.  
11| But the Lord was with me as a mighty  man of war: therefore they persecuted <i>me</i>, but could not perceive <i> anything against me</i>; they were greatly confounded, for they perceived not  their disgrace, which shall never be forgotten.  
12| O Lord, that provest just <i>deeds</i>,  understanding the reins and hearts, let me see thy vengeance upon them: for to  thee I have revealed my cause. 
13|  Sing ye to the Lord, sing praise to him: for he has rescued the soul of the poor  from the hand of evil-doers.
14| Cursed be the day wherein I was born:  the day wherein my mother brought me forth, let it not be blessed.  
15| Cursed be the man who brought the glad  tidings to my father, saying, A male child is born to thee.  
16| Let that man rejoice as the cities which  the Lord overthrew in wrath, and repented not: let him hear crying in the  morning, and loud lamentation at noon; 
17|  because he slew me not in the womb, and my mother became not my  tomb, and her womb always great with me. 
18|  Why is it that I came forth of the womb to see troubles and  distresses, and my days are spent in shame? Chapter  21  

#21
1| THE WORD THAT CAME FROM THE LORD TO  JEREMIAS, WHEN KING SEDEKIAS SENT TO HIM PASCHOR THE SON OF MELCHIAS, AND  SOPHONIAS SON OF BASAEAS, THE PRIEST, SAYING, 
2| Enquire of the Lord for us; for the  king of Babylon has risen up against us; if the Lord will do according to all  his wonderful works, and <i>the king</i> shall depart from us.  
3| And Jeremias said to them, Thus shall  ye say to Sedekias king of Juda, 
4|  Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> turn back the weapons of war  wherewith ye fight against the Chaldeans that have besieged you from outside the  wall, and I will gather them into the midst of this city. 
 5| And I will fight against you with an outstretched hand  and with a strong arm, with wrath and great anger. 
6| And I will smite all the dwellers in this city, <i>both</i>  men and cattle, with grievous pestilence: and they shall die.  
7| And after this, thus saith the Lord; I  will give Sedekias king of Juda, and his servants, and the people that is left  in this city from the pestilence, and from the famine, and from the sword, into  the hands of their enemies, that seek their lives: and they shall cut them in  pieces with the edge of the sword: I will not spare them, and I will not have  compassion upon them.
8| And thou shalt say to this people,  Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I have set before you the way of life, and the way  of death. 
9| He that remains in this  city shall die by the sword, and by famine: but he that goes forth to advance to  the Chaldeans that have besieged you, shall live, and his life shall be to him  for a spoil, and he shall live. 
10|  For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good: it shall be  delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall consume it with  fire.  
11| O house of the king of Juda, hear ye  the word of the Lord. 
12| O house of  David, thus saith the Lord; Judge judgment in the morning, and act rightly, and  rescue the spoiled one from the hand of him that wrongs him, lest mine anger be  kindled like fire, and it burn, and there be none to quench <i>it</i>.  
13| Behold, I am against thee that dwellest  in the valley of Sor; in the plain country, <i>even against</i> them that say,  Who shall alarm us? or who shall enter into our habitation?  
14| And I will kindle a fire in the forest  thereof, and it shall devour all things round about it. Chapter  22  

#22
1| Thus saith the Lord; Go thou, and  go down to the house of the king of Juda, and thou shalt speak there this word, 
2| and thou shalt say,  Hear the word of the Lord, O king of Juda, that sittest on the  throne of David, thou, and thy house, and thy people, and they that go in at  these gates: 
3| thus saith the Lord;  Execute ye judgment and justice, and rescue the spoiled out of the hand of him  that wrongs him: and oppress not the stranger, and orphan, and widow, and sin  not, and shed no innocent blood in this place. 
4|  For if ye will indeed perform this word, then shall there enter  in by the gates of this house kings sitting upon the throne of David, and riding  on chariots and horses, they, and their servants, and their people.  
5| But if ye will not perform these words,  by myself have I sworn, saith the Lord, that this house shall be <i>brought</i>  to desolation.  
6| For thus saith the Lord concerning the  house of the king of Juda; Thou art Galaad to me, <i>and</i> the head of  Libanus: <i>yet</i> surely I will make thee a desert, <i>even</i> cities that  shall not be inhabited: 
7| and I will  bring upon thee a destroying man, and his axe: and they shall cut down thy  choice cedars, and cast <i>them</i> into the fire. 
8| And nations shall pass through this city, and each shall  say to his neighbour, Why has the Lord done thus to this great city?  
9| And they shall say, Because they forsook  the covenant of the Lord their God, and worshipped strange gods, and served  them.
10| Weep not for the dead, nor lament for  him: weep bitterly for him that goes away: for he shall return no more, nor see  his native land. 
11| For thus saith  the Lord concerning Sellem the son of Josias, who reigns in the place of Josias  his father, who has gone forth out of this place; He shall not return thither  any more: 
12| but in that place  whither I have carried him captive, there shall he die, and shall see this land  no more.  
13| He that builds his house not with  justice, and his upper chambers not with judgment, who works by means of his  neighbour for nothing, and will by no means give him his reward.  
14| Thou hast built for thyself a  well-proportioned house, airy chambers, fitted with windows, and wainscoted with  cedar, and painted with vermilion. 
15|  Shalt thou reign, because thou art provoked with thy father  Achaz? they shall not eat, and they shall not drink: it is better for thee to  execute judgment and justice. 
16|  They understood not, they judged not the cause of the afflicted, nor the cause  of the poor: is not this thy not knowing me? saith the Lord.  
17| Behold, thine eyes are not good, nor  thine heart, but <i>they go</i> after thy covetousness, and after the innocent  blood to shed it, and after acts of injustice and slaughter, to commit them.  
18| Therefore thus saith the Lord  concerning Joakim son of Josias, king of Juda, even concerning this man; they  shall not bewail him, <i>saying</i>, Ah brother! neither shall they at all weep  for him, <i>saying</i>, Alas Lord. 
19|  He shall be buried with the burial of an ass; he shall be dragged  roughly along and cast outside the gate of Jerusalem.
20| Go up to Libanus, and cry; and utter  thy voice to Basan, and cry aloud to the extremity of the sea: for all thy  lovers are destroyed. 
21| I spoke to  thee on <i>occasion of</i> thy trespass, but thou saidst, I will not hearken.  This <i>has been</i> thy way from thy youth, thou hast not hearkened to my  voice. 
22| The wind shall tend all  thy shepherds, and thy lovers shall go into captivity; for then shalt thou be  ashamed and disgraced because of all thy lovers. 
23|  O thou that dwellest in Libanus, making thy nest in the cedars,  thou shalt groan heavily, when pangs as of a travailing woman are come upon  thee.  
24| <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord,  though Jechonias son of Joakim king of Juda were indeed the seal upon my right  hand, thence would I pluck thee; 
25|  and I will deliver thee into the hands of them that seek thy life, before whom  thou art afraid, into the hands of the Chaldeans. 
26| And I will cast forth thee, and thy mother that bore thee,  into a land where thou wast not born; and there ye shall die.  
27| But they shall by no means return to the  land which they long for in their souls. 
28|  Jechonias is dishonoured as a good-for-nothing vessel; for he is  thrown out and cast forth into a land which he knew not.  
29| Land, land, hear the word of the  Lord. 
30| Write ye this man an  outcast: for there shall none of his seed at all grow up to sit on the throne of  David, <i>or as</i> a prince yet in Juda. Chapter  23

1| Woe to the shepherds that destroy  and scatter the sheep of their pasture! 
2|  Therefore thus saith the Lord against them that tend my people;  Ye have scattered my sheep, and driven them out, and ye have not visited them:  behold, I <i>will</i> take vengeance upon you according to your evil practices. 
3| And I will gather in the remnant  of my people in every land, whither I have driven them out, and will set them in  their pasture; and they shall increase and be multiplied. 
 4| And I will raise up shepherds to them, who shall feed  them: and they shall fear no more, nor be alarmed, saith the Lord.  
5| Behold, the days come, saith the Lord,  when I will raise up to David a righteous branch, and a king shall reign and  understand, and shall execute judgment and righteousness on the earth.  
6| In his days both Juda shall be saved, and  Israel shall dwell securely: and this is his name, which the Lord shall call  him, Josedec among the prophets. 
7|  Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when they shall no more say,  The Lord lives, who brought up the house of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 
8| but The Lord lives, who has  gathered the whole seed of Israel from the north land, and from all the  countries whither he <i>had</i> driven them out, and has restored them into  their own land.
9| My heart is broken within me; all my  bones are shaken: I am become as a broken-down man, and as a man overcome with  wine, because of the Lord, and because of the excellence of his glory.  
10| For because of these things the land  mourns; the pastures of the wilderness are dried up; and their course is become  evil, and so <i>also</i> their strength. 
11|  For priest and prophet are defiled; and I have seen their  iniquities in my house. 
12| Therefore  let their way be to them slippery and dark: and they shall be tripped up and  fall in it: for I will bring evils upon them, in the year of their visitation.  
13| And in the prophets of Samaria I have  seen lawless deeds; they prophesied by Baal, and led my people Israel astray. 
14| Also in the prophets of Jerusalem  I have seen horrible things: as they committed adultery, and walked in lies, and  strengthened the hands of many, that they should not return each from his evil  way: they are all become to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants thereof as  Gomorrha.  
15| Therefore thus saith the Lord;  Behold, I will feed them with pain, and give them bitter water to drink: for  from the prophets of Jerusalem has defilement gone forth <i>into</i> all the  land.  
16| Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Hearken  not to the words of the prophets: for they frame a vain vision for themselves;  they speak from their own heart, and not from the mouth of the Lord.  
17| They say to them that reject the word of  the Lord, There shall be peace to you; and to all that walk after their own  lusts, and to everyone that walks in the error of his heart, they have said, No  evil shall come upon thee. 
18| For  who has stood in the counsel of the Lord, and seen his word? who has hearkened,  and heard? 
19| Behold, <i>there is</i>  an earthquake from the Lord, and anger proceeds to a convulsion, it shall come  violently upon the ungodly. 
20| And  the Lord’s wrath shall return no more, until he have accomplished it, and until  he have established it, according to the purpose of his heart: at the end of the  days they shall understand it.  
21| I sent not the prophets, yet they  ran: neither spoke I to them, yet they prophesied. 
22| But if they had stood in my counsel, and if they had  hearkened to my words, then would they have turned my people from their evil  practices.  
23| I am a God nigh at hand, saith the  Lord, and not a God afar off. 
24|  Shall any one hide himself in secret places, and I not see him? Do I not fill  heaven and earth? saith the Lord.  
25| I have heard what the prophets say,  what they prophesy in my name, saying falsely, I have seen a night vision. 
26| How long shall <i>these things</i>  be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies, when they prophesy the  purposes of their own heart? 
27| who  devise that <i>men</i> may forget my law by their dreams, which they have told  every one to his neighbour, as their fathers forgot my name in <i>the worship of</i>  Baal. 
28| The prophet who has a  dream, let him tell his dream; and <i>he</i> in whom is my word <i>spoken</i> to  him, let him tell my word truly: what is the chaff to the corn? so are my words,  saith the Lord. 
29| Behold, are not  my words as fire? saith the Lord; and as an axe cutting the rock?  
30| Behold, I am therefore against the  prophets, saith the Lord God, that steal my words every one from his neighbour. 
31| Behold, I am against the prophets  that put forth prophecies of mere words, and slumber their sleep.  
32| Therefore, behold, I am against the  prophets that prophesy false dreams, and have not told them <i>truly</i>, and  have caused my people to err by their lies, and by their errors; yet I sent them  not, and commanded them not; therefore, they shall not profit this people at  all.
33| And if this people, or the priest, or  the prophet, should ask, What is the burden of the Lord? then thou shalt say to  them, Ye are the burden, and I will dash you down, saith the Lord.  
34| <i>As for</i> the prophet, and the  priests, and the people, who shall say, The burden of the Lord, I will even take  vengeance on that man, and on his house. 
35|  Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every one to  his brother, What has the Lord answered? and, what has the Lord said?  
36| And do ye name no more the burden of the  Lord; for his own word shall be a man’s burden. 
37|  But wherefore, <i>say ye</i>, has the Lord our God spoken?  
38| Therefore thus saith the Lord our God;  Because ye have spoken this word, The burden of the Lord, and I sent to you,  saying, ye shall not say, The burden of the Lord; 
39| therefore, behold, I <i>will</i> seize, and dash down you  and the city which I gave to you and your fathers. 
40| And I will bring upon you an everlasting reproach, and  everlasting disgrace, which shall not be forgotten. 
7| Therefore, behold, the days come,  saith the Lord, when they shall no more say, The Lord lives, who brought up the  house of Israel out of the land of Egypt; 
8|  but The Lord lives, who has gathered the whole seed of Israel  from the north land, and from all the countries whither he <i>had</i> driven  them out, and has restored them into their own land.  Chapter  24

1| The Lord shewed me two baskets of  figs, lying in front of the temple of the Lord, after Nabuchodonosor king of  Babylon had carried captive Jechonias son of Joakim king of Juda, and the  princes, and the artificers, and the prisoners, and the rich men out of  Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. 
2|  The one basket was <i>full</i> of very good figs, as the early  figs; and the other basket was <i>full</i> of very bad figs, which could not be  eaten, for their badness. 
3| And the  Lord said to me, What seest thou, Jeremias? and I said, Figs; the good figs,  very good; and the bad, very bad, which cannot be eaten, for their badness.  
4| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying, 
5| Thus saith the Lord, the  God of Israel; As these good figs, so will I acknowledge the Jews that have been  carried away captive, whom I have sent forth out of this place into the land of  the Chaldeans for good. 
6| And I will  fix mine eyes upon them for good, and I will restore them into this land for  good: and I will build them up, and not pull them down; and I will plant them,  and not pluck them up.  
7| And I will give them a heart to know  me, that I am the Lord: and they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them  a God: for they shall turn to me with all their heart.  
8| And as the bad figs, which cannot be  eaten, for their badness; thus saith the Lord, So will I deliver Sedekias king  of Juda, and his nobles, and the remnant of Jerusalem, them that are left in  this land, and the dwellers in Egypt. 
9|  And I will cause them to be dispersed into all the kingdoms of  the earth, and they shall be for a reproach, and a proverb, and an <i>object of</i>  hatred, and a curse, in every place whither I have driven them out.  
10| And I will send against them famine, and  pestilence, and the sword, until they are consumed from off the land which I  gave them. Chapter  25  

#25
1| THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS  concerning all the people of Juda in the fourth year of Joakim, son of Josias,  king of Juda; 
2| which he spoke to  all the people of Juda, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying,  
3| In the thirteenth year of Josias, son  of Amos, king of Juda, even until this day for three and twenty years, I have  both spoken to you, rising early and speaking, 
4|  and I sent to you my servants the prophets, sending them early;  (but ye hearkened not, and listened not with your ears;) saying,  
5| Turn ye every one from his evil way, and  from your evil practices, and ye shall dwell in the land which I gave to you and  your fathers, of old and for ever. 
6|  Go ye not after strange gods, to serve them, and to worship them,  that ye provoke me not by the works of your hands, to do you hurt.  
7| But ye hearkened not to me.
8| Therefore thus saith the Lord; Since  ye believed not my words, 
9| behold I <i>will</i> send and take a family from the north, and will bring them against  this land, and against the inhabitants of it, and against all the nations round  about it, and I will make them utterly waste, and make them a desolation, and a  hissing, and an everlasting reproach. 
10|  And I will destroy from <i>among</i> them the voice of joy, and  the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride,  the scent of ointment, and the light of a candle. 
11| And all the land shall be a desolation; and they shall  serve among the Gentiles seventy years.  
12| And when the seventy years are  fulfilled, I will take vengeance on that nation, and will make them a perpetual  desolation. 
13| And I will bring upon  that land all my words which I have spoken against it, <i>even</i> all things  that are written in this book. 
34|  THE PROPHECIES OF JEREMIAS AGAINST  THE NATIONS OF ÆLAM.  
35| Thus saith the Lord, The bow of Ælam  is broken, <i>even</i> the chief of their power. 
36|  And I will bring upon Ælam the four winds from the four corners  of heaven, and I will disperse them toward all these winds; and there shall be  no nation <i>to</i> which they shall not come—<i>even</i> the outcasts of Ælam. 
37| And I will put them in fear  before their enemies that seek their life; and I will bring evils upon them  according to my great anger; and I will send forth my sword after them, until I  have utterly destroyed them. 
38| And  I will set my throne in Ælam, and will send forth thence king and rulers.  
39| But it shall come to pass at the end of  days, that I will turn the captivity of Ælam, saith the Lord.  Chapter  26  

#26
1|  In the beginning of the reign of king  Sedekias, there came this word concerning Ælam.  
2| FOR EGYPT, AGAINST THE POWER OF PHARAO NECHAO  KING OF EGYPT, who was by the river Euphrates in Charmis, whom Nabuchodonosor  king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of Joakim king of Juda.   
3|  Take up arms and spears, and draw nigh to  battle; 
4|  and harness the horses: mount, ye horsemen, and  stand ready in your helmets; advance the spears, and put on your breast-plates.  
5| Why do they fear, and turn back? even because  their mighty men shall be slain: they have utterly fled, and being hemmed in  they have not rallied, saith the Lord. 
6|  Let not the swift  flee, and let not the mighty man escape to the north: the <i>forces</i> at  Euphrates are become feeble, and they have fallen.  
7| Who is this <i>that</i> shall come up as a  river, and as rivers roll <i>their</i> waves? 
8|  The waters  of Egypt shall come up like a river: and he said, I will go up, and will cover  the earth, and will destroy the dwellers in it. 
9|  Mount ye  the horses, prepare the chariots; go forth, ye warriors of the Ethiopians, and  Libyans armed with shields; and mount, ye Lydians, bend the bow.  
10|  And that day <i>shall be</i> to the Lord our God a day of  vengeance, to take vengeance on his enemies: and the sword of the Lord shall  devour, and be glutted, and be drunken with their blood: for the Lord <i>has</i>  a sacrifice from the land of the north at the river Euphrates.   
11| Go up to Galaad, and take balm for the  virgin daughter of Egypt: in vain hast thou multiplied thy medicines; there is  no help in thee. 
12|  The nations have heard thy voice, and  the land has been filled with thy cry: for the warriors have fainted fighting  one against another, <i>and</i> both are fallen together.  
13| THE WORDS WHICH THE LORD SPOKE by Jeremias,  concerning the coming of the king of Babylon to smite the land of Egypt.   
14| Proclaim <i>it</i> at Magdol, and declare <i> it</i> at Memphis: say ye, Stand up, and prepare; for the sword has devoured thy  yew-tree.  
15| Wherefore has Apis fled from thee? thy  choice calf has not remained; for the Lord has utterly weakened him.  
16|  And thy multitude has fainted and fallen; and each one said to  his neighbour, Let us arise, and return into our country to our people, from the  Grecian sword. 
17|  Call ye the name of Pharao Nechao king  of Egypt, Saon esbeie moed. 
18|  <i>As</i> I live, saith the  Lord God, he shall come as Itabyrion among the mountains, and as Carmel that is  on the sea. 
19|  O daughter of Egypt dwelling <i>at home</i>,  prepare thee stuff for removing: for Memphis shall be utterly desolate, and  shall be called Woe, because there are no inhabitants in it.  
20| Egypt is a fair heifer, <i>but</i>  destruction from the north is come upon her. 
21|  Also her  hired <i>soldiers</i> in the midst of her are as fatted calves fed in her; for  they also have turned, and fled with one accord: they stood not, for the day of  destruction was come upon them, and the time of their retribution.  
22|  Their voice is as <i>that</i> of a hissing serpent, for they go  upon the sand; they shall come upon Egypt with axes, as men that cut wood. 
23|  They shall cut down her forest, saith the Lord, for <i> their number</i> cannot at all be conjectured, for it exceeds the locust in  multitude, and they are innumerable. 
24|  The daughter of  Egypt is confounded; she is delivered into the hands of a people from the north.  
25| Behold, I <i>will</i> avenge Ammon her son  upon Pharao, and upon them that trust in him.  
26 27| But fear not thou, my servant Jacob,  neither be thou alarmed, Israel: for, behold, I will save thee from afar, and  thy seed from their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and be at ease, and  sleep, and there shall be no one to trouble him. 
28|  Fear  not thou, my servant Jacob, saith the Lord; for I am with thee: she <i>that was</i>  without fear and in luxury, has been delivered up: for I will make a full end of  every nation among whom I have thrust thee forth; but I will not cause thee to  fail: yet will I chastise thee in the way of judgment, and will not hold thee  entirely guiltless. Chapter  27  

#27
1|  THE WORD OF THE LORD WHICH HE SPOKE  AGAINST BABYLON.  
2| Proclaim ye among the Gentiles, and  cause the tidings to be heard, and suppress <i>them</i> not: say ye, Babylon is  taken, Belus is confounded; the fearless, the luxurious Maerodach is delivered  up. 
3| For a nation has come up  against her from the north, he shall utterly ravage her land, and there shall be  none to dwell in it, neither man nor beast.  
4| In those days, and at that time, the  children of Israel shall come, they and the children of Juda together; they  shall proceed, weeping as they go, seeking the Lord their God.  
5| They shall ask the way till <i>they come  to</i> Sion, for that way shall they set their face; and they shall come and  flee for refuge to the Lord their God; for the everlasting covenant shall not be  forgotten.  
6| My people have been lost sheep: their  shepherds thrust them out, they caused them to wander on the mountains: they  went from mountain to hill, they forgot their resting-place.  
7|  All that found them consumed them: their  enemies said, Let us not leave them alone, because they have sinned against the  Lord: he that gathered their fathers <i>had</i> a pasture of righteousness.  
8| Flee ye out of the midst of Babylon,  and from the land of the Chaldeans, and go forth, and be as serpents before  sleep. 
9| For, behold, I stir up  against Babylon the gatherings of nations out of the land of the north; and they  shall set themselves in array against her: thence shall she be taken, as the  dart of an expert warrior shall not return empty. 
10| And Chaldea shall be a spoil: all that spoil her shall be  satisfied.  
11| Because ye rejoiced, and boasted, <i> while</i> plundering mine heritage; because ye exulted as calves in the grass,  and pushed with the horn as bulls. 
12|  Your mother is greatly ashamed; your mother that bore you for  prosperity is confounded: <i>she is</i> the last of the nations, desolate, 
13|  by reason of the Lord’s anger: it  shall not be inhabited, but it shall be all a desolation; and every one that  passes through Babylon shall scowl, and they shall hiss at all her plague.  
14| Set yourselves in array against  Babylon round about, all ye that bend the bow; shoot at her, spare not your  arrows, 
15| and prevail against her:  her hands are weakened, her bulwarks are fallen, and her wall is broken down:  for it is vengeance from God: take vengeance upon her; as she has done, do to  her. 
16| Utterly destroy seed out of  Babylon, <i>and</i> him that holds a sickle in time of harvest: for fear of the  Grecian sword, they shall return every one to his people, and every one shall  flee to his own land.  
17| Israel is a wandering sheep; the  lions have driven him out: the king of Assyria first devoured him, and afterward  this king of Babylon <i>has gnawed</i> his bones. 
18| Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> take  vengeance on the king of Babylon, and upon his land, as I took vengeance on the  king of Assyria. 
19| And I will  restore Israel to his pasture, and he shall feed on Carmel and on mount Ephraim  and in Galaad, and his soul shall be satisfied. 
20|  In those days, and at that time, they shall seek for the iniquity  of Israel, and there shall be none; and for the sins of Juda, and they shall not  be found: for I will be merciful to them that are left 
21| on the land, saith the Lord.  Go up against it roughly, and against them that dwell on it:  avenge, O sword, and destroy utterly, saith the Lord, and do according to all  that I command thee. 
22| A sound of  war, and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans! 
 23| How is the hammer of the whole earth broken and  crushed! How is Babylon become a desolation among the nations!  
24| They shall come upon thee, and thou  shalt not know it, Babylon, that thou wilt even be taken captive: thou art found  and taken, because thou didst resist the Lord.  
25| The Lord has opened his treasury, and  brought forth the weapons of his anger: for the Lord God <i>has</i> a work in  the land of the Chaldeans. 
26|  For  her times are come: open ye her storehouses: search her as a cave, and utterly  destroy her: let there be no remnant of her. 
27|   Dry ye up all her fruits, and let them go down to the slaughter: woe to them!  for their day is come, and the time of their retribution. 
 28| A voice of men fleeing and escaping from the land of  Babylon, to declare to Sion the vengeance <i>that comes</i> from the Lord our  God.  
29| Summon many against Babylon, <i>even</i>  every one that bends the bow: camp against her round about; let no one of her <i> people</i> escape: render to her according to her works; according to all that  she has done, do to her: for she has resisted the Lord, the Holy God of Israel. 
30| Therefore shall her young men  fall in the streets, and all her warriors shall be cast down, saith the Lord.  
31| Behold, I am against thee the haughty  one, saith the Lord: for thy day is come, and the time of thy retribution. 
32| And thy pride shall fail, and  fall, and there shall be no one to set it up again: and I will kindle a fire in  her forest, and it shall devour all things round about her.
33| Thus saith the Lord; The children of  Israel and the children of Juda have been oppressed: all they that have taken  them captive have oppressed them together; for they would not let them go. 
34| But their Redeemer is strong; the  Lord Almighty is his name: he will enter into judgment with his adversaries,  that he may destroy the earth; 
35|  and he will sharpen a sword against the Chaldeans, and against the inhabitants  of Babylon, and upon her nobles and upon her wise men; 
36| a sword upon her warriors, and they shall be weakened: a  sword upon their horses, and upon their chariots: 
37| a sword upon their warriors and upon the mixed people in  the midst of her; and they shall be as women: a sword upon the treasures, and  they shall be scattered upon her water, 
38|  and they shall be ashamed: for it is a land of graven <i>images</i>;  and in the islands, where they boasted. 
39|  Therefore shall idols dwell in the islands, and the young of  monsters shall dwell in it: it shall not be inhabited any more for ever.  
40| As God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrha, and  the cities bordering upon them, saith the Lord: no man shall dwell there, and no  son of man shall sojourn there.  
41| Behold, a people comes from the  north, and a great nation, and many kings shall be stirred up from the end of  the earth; holding bow and dagger: 
42|  <i>the people</i> is fierce, and will have no mercy: their voices  shall sound as the sea, they shall ride upon horses, prepared for war, like  fire, against thee, O daughter of Babylon. 
43|  The king of Babylon heard the sound of them, and his hands were  enfeebled: anguish overcame him, pangs as of a woman in travail.  
44|  Behold, he shall come up as a lion from  Jordan to Gaethan; for I will speedily drive them from her, and I will set all  the youths against her: for who is like me? and who will resist me? and who is  this shepherd who will stand before me?  
45| Therefore hear ye the counsel of the  Lord, which he has taken against Babylon; and his devices, which he has devised  upon the Chaldeans inhabiting <i>it</i>: surely lambs of their flock shall be  destroyed: surely pasture shall be cut off from them. 
46| For at the sound of the taking of Babylon the earth shall  quake, and a cry shall be heard among the nations.  Chapter  28  

#28
1| Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I stir  up against Babylon, and against the Chaldeans dwelling therein, a deadly burning  wind. 
2| And I will send forth  against Babylon spoilers, and they shall spoil her, and shall ravage her land.  Woe to Babylon round about <i>her</i> in the day of her affliction.  
3| Let the archer bend his bow, and him that  has armour put it on: and spare ye not her young men, but destroy ye all her  host. 
4| And slain men shall fall in  the land of the Chaldeans, and <i>men</i> pierced through shall fall without it.  
5| For Israel and Juda have not been  forsaken of their God, of the Lord Almighty; whereas their land was filled with  iniquity against the holy things of Israel. 
6|  Flee ye out of the midst of Babylon, and deliver every one his  soul: and be not overthrown in her iniquity; for it is the time of her  retribution from the Lord; he is rendering to her a recompence.  
7| Babylon has been a golden cup in the  Lord’s hand, causing all the earth to be drunken: the nations have drunk of her  wine; therefore they were shaken. 
8|  And Babylon is fallen suddenly, and is broken to pieces: lament for her; take  balm for her deadly wound, if by any means she may be healed.  
9| We tried to heal Babylon, but she was not  healed: let us forsake her, and depart every one to his own country: for her  judgment has reached to the heaven, it has mounted up to the stars.  
10| The Lord has brought forth his judgment:  come, and let us declare in Sion the works of the Lord our God.  
11| Prepare the arrows; fill the quivers:  the Lord has stirred up the spirit of the king of the Medes: for his wrath is  against Babylon, to destroy it utterly; for it is the Lord’s vengeance, it is  the vengeance of his people. 
12| Lift  up a standard on the walls of Babylon, prepare the quivers, rouse the guards,  prepare the weapons: for the Lord has taken <i>the work</i> in hand, and will  execute what he has spoken against the inhabitants of Babylon,  
13| dwelling on many waters, and amidst the  abundance of her treasures; thine end is come verily into thy bowels.  
14| For the Lord has sworn by his arm, <i> saying, </i>I will fill thee with men as with locusts; and they that come down  shall cry against thee.  
15| The Lord made the earth by his power,  preparing the world by his wisdom, by his understanding he stretched out the  heaven. 
16| At <i>his</i> voice he  makes a sound of water in the heaven, and brings up clouds from the extremity of  the earth; he makes lightnings for rain, and brings light out of his treasures. 
17| Every man has completely lost  understanding; every goldsmith is confounded because of his graven <i>images</i>:  for they have cast false <i>gods</i>, there is no breath in them.  
18| They are vain works, objects of scorn;  in the time of their visitation they shall perish. 
19| Not such is Jacob’s portion; for he that formed all  things, he is his inheritance; the Lord is his name. 
20| Thou scatterest for me the weapons of  war: and I will scatter nations by thee, and will destroy kings by means of  thee. 
21| And by thee I will scatter  the horse and his rider; and by thee I will scatter chariots and them that ride  in them. 
22| And by thee I will  scatter youth and maid; and by thee I will scatter man and woman.  
23| And by thee I will scatter the shepherd  and his flock; and by thee I will scatter the husbandman and his husbandry; and  by thee I will scatter leaders and the captains. 
24|  And I will recompense to Babylon and to all the Chaldeans that  dwell <i>there</i> all their mischiefs that they have done to Sion before your  eyes, saith the Lord.  
25| Behold, I am against thee, the ruined  mountain, that destroys the whole earth; and I will stretch out mine hand upon  thee, and will roll thee down upon the rocks, and will make thee as a burnt  mountain. 
26| And they shall not take  from thee a stone for a corner, nor a stone for a foundation: for thou shalt be  a desolation for ever, saith the Lord.  
27| Lift up a standard in the land, sound  the trumpet among the nations, consecrate the nations against her, raise up  kings against her by me, and <i>that</i> for the people of Achanaz; set against  her engines of war; bring up against her horses as a multitude of locusts. 
28| Bring up nations against her, <i> even</i> the king of the Medes and of the whole earth, his rulers, and all his  captains. 
29| The earth has quaked  and been troubled, because the purpose of the Lord has risen up against Babylon,  to make the land of Babylon a desolation, and uninhabitable.  
30| The warrior of Babylon has failed to  fight; they shall sit there in the siege; their power is broken; they are become  like women; her tabernacles have been set on fire; her bars are broken.  
31| One shall rush, running to meet <i> another</i> runner, and one <i>shall go</i> with tidings to meet <i>another</i>  with tidings, to bring tidings to the king of Babylon, that his city is taken. 
32| At the end of his passages they  were taken, and his cisterns they have burnt with fire, and his warriors are  going forth.  
33| For thus saith the Lord, The houses  of the king of Babylon shall be threshed as a floor in the season; yet a little  while, and her harvest shall come.  
34| He has devoured me, he has torn me  asunder, airy darkness has come upon me; Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon has  swallowed me up, as a dragon has he filled his belly with my delicacies.  
35| My troubles and my distresses have  driven me out into Babylon, shall she that dwells in Sion say; and my blood <i> shall be</i> upon the Chaldeans dwelling <i>there</i>, shall Jerusalem say.  
36| Therefore thus saith the Lord,  Behold, I will judge thine adversary, and I will execute vengeance for thee; and  I will waste her sea, and dry up her fountain. 
37|  And Babylon shall be a desolation, and shall not be inhabited. 
38| For they rose up together as  lions, and as lions’ whelps. 
39| In  their heat I will give them a draught, and make them drunk, that they may be  stupified, and sleep an everlasting sleep, and not awake, saith the Lord.  
40| And bring thou them down as lambs to the  slaughter, and rams with kids.  
41| How has the boast of all the earth  been taken and caught in a snare! how has Babylon become a desolation among the  nations! 
42| The sea has come up upon  Babylon with the sound of its waves, and she is covered. 
 43| Her cities are become like a dry and trackless land;  not so much as one <i>man</i> shall dwell in it, neither shall a son of man  lodge in it. 
44| And I will take  vengeance on Babylon, and bring forth out of her mouth what she has swallowed  down, and the nations shall no more be gathered to her: 
45  46 47 48 49| and in Babylon the slain men of all the earth  shall fall. 
50| Go forth of the land,  ye that escape, and stay not; ye that are afar off, remember the Lord, and let  Jerusalem come into your mind. 
51| We  are ashamed, because we have heard our reproach; disgrace has covered our face;  aliens are come into our sanctuary, <i>even</i> into the house of the Lord.  
52| Therefore, behold, the days come,  saith the Lord, when I will take vengeance upon her graven <i>images</i>: and  slain men shall fall in all her land. 
53|  For though Babylon should go up as the heaven, and though she  should strengthen her walls with her power, from me shall come they that shall  destroy her, saith the Lord. 
54| A  sound of a cry in Babylon, and great destruction in the land of the Chaldeans: 
55| for the Lord has utterly  destroyed Babylon, and cut off from her the great voice sounding as many waters:  he has consigned her voice to destruction. 
56|  For distress has come upon Babylon, her warriors are taken, their  bows are useless: for God recompenses them. 
57|  The Lord recompenses, and will make her leaders and her wise men  and her captains completely drunk, saith the King, the Lord Almighty is his  name.  
58| Thus saith the Lord, The wall of  Babylon was made broad, but it shall be completely broken down, and her high  gates shall be burnt with fire; and the peoples shall not labour in vain, nor  the nations fail in <i>their</i> rule.
59| THE WORD WHICH THE LORD COMMANDED THE  PROPHET JEREMIAS to say to Saraeas son of Nerias, son of Maasaeas, when he went  from Sedekias king of Juda to Babylon, in the fourth year of his reign. And  Saraeas was over the bounties. 
60|  And Jeremias wrote in a book all the evils which should come upon Babylon, <i> even</i> all these words that are written against Babylon.  
61|  And Jeremias said to Saraeas, When thou  art come to Babylon, and shalt see and read all these words;  
62| then thou shalt say, O Lord God, thou  hast spoken against this place, to destroy it, and that there should be none to  dwell in it, neither man nor beast; for it shall be a desolation for ever. 
63| And it shall come to pass, when  thou shalt cease from reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone upon it,  and cast it into the midst of Euphrates; 
64|  and shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and not rise, because of  the evils which I bring upon it.  Chapter  29

1|  THUS SAITH THE LORD AGAINST THE  PHILISTINES; 
2| Behold, waters come up from the north,  and shall become a sweeping torrent, and it shall sweep away the land, and its  fulness; the city, and them that dwell in it: and men shall cry and all that  dwell in the land shall howl, 
3| at  the sound of his rushing, at <i>the sound of</i> his hoofs, and at the rattling  of his chariots, at the noise of his wheels: the fathers turned not to their  children because of the weakness of their hands, 
4|  in the day that is coming to destroy all the Philistines: and I  will utterly destroy Tyre and Sidon and all the rest of their allies: for the  Lord will destroy the remaining <i>inhabitants</i> of the islands.  
5| Baldness is come upon Gaza; Ascalon is  cast away, and the remnant of the Enakim.  
6| How long wilt thou smite, O sword of  the Lord? how long will it be ere thou art quiet? return into thy sheath, rest,  and be removed. 
7| How shall it be  quiet, whereas the Lord has given it a commission against Ascalon, and against  the regions on the sea-coast, to awake against the remaining <i>countries</i>! 
7| CONCERNING IDUMEA, thus saith the  Lord; There is no longer wisdom in Thaeman, counsel has perished from the wise  ones, their wisdom is gone, 
8| their  place has been deceived. Dig deep for a dwelling, ye that inhabit Daedam, for he  has wrought grievously: I brought trouble upon him in the time at which I  visited him. 
9| For grape-gatherers  are come, who shall not leave thee a remnant; as thieves by night, they shall  lay their hand upon <i>thy possessions</i>.  
10| For I have stripped Esau, I have  uncovered their secret places; they shall have no power to hide themselves, they  have perished <i>each</i> by the hand of his brother, my neighbour, and it is  impossible 
11| for thy fatherless one  to be left to live, but I shall live, and the widows trust in me.  
12| For thus saith the Lord; They who  were not appointed to drink the cup have drunk <i>it</i>; and thou shalt by no  means be cleared: 
13| for by myself I  have sworn, saith the Lord, that thou shalt be in the midst of her an impassable <i>land</i>, and a reproach, and a curse; and all her cities shall be desert for  ever.  
14| I have heard a report from the Lord,  and he has sent messengers to the nations, <i>saying, </i>Assemble yourselves,  and come against her; rise ye up to war. 
15|  I have made thee small among the nations, utterly contemptible  among men. 
16| Thine insolence has  risen up against thee, the fierceness of thine heart has burst the holes of the  rocks, it has seized upon the strength of a lofty hill; for as an eagle he set  his nest on high: thence will I bring thee down.  
17| And Idumea shall be a desert: every  one that passes by shall hiss at it. 
18|  As Sodom was overthrown and Gomorrha and they that sojourned in  her, saith the Lord Almighty, no man shall dwell there, nor shall any son of man  inhabit there. 
19| Behold, he shall  come up as a lion out of the midst of Jordan to the place of Ætham: for I will  speedily drive them from it, and do ye set the young men against her: for who is  like me? and who will withstand me? and who <i>is</i> this shepherd, who shall  confront me?  
20| Therefore hear ye the counsel of the  Lord, which he has framed against Idumea; and his device, which he has devised  against the inhabitants of Thaeman: surely the least of the sheep shall be swept  off; surely their dwelling shall be made desolate for them.  
21| For at the sound of their fall the earth  was scared, and the cry of the sea was not heard. 
22| Behold, he shall look <i>upon her</i> as an eagle, and  spread forth <i>his</i> wings over her strongholds; and the heart of the mighty  men of Idumea shall be in that day as the heart of a woman in her pangs.  Chapter  30

1| CONCERNING THE SONS OF AMMON thus  saith the Lord, Are there no sons in Israel? or have they no one to succeed <i> them</i>? wherefore has Melchol inherited Galaad, and why shall their people  dwell in their cities? 
2| Therefore,  behold, the days come, saith the Lord, when I will cause to be heard in Rabbath  a tumult of wars; and they shall become a waste and ruined place, and her altars  shall be burned with fire; then shall Israel succeed to his dominion.  
3| Howl, O Esebon, for Gai has perished;  cry, ye daughters of Rabbath, gird yourselves with sack-clothes, and lament; for  Melchol shall go into banishment, his priests and his princes together.   
4| Why do ye exult in the plains of the  Enakim, thou haughty daughter, that trustest in <i>thy</i> treasures, that  sayest, Who shall come in to me? 
5|  Behold, I <i>will</i> bring terror upon thee, saith the Lord, from all the  country round about thee; and ye shall be scattered every one right before him,  and there is none to gather you.  
28| CONCERNING KEDAR THE QUEEN OF THE  PALACE, WHOM NABUCHODONOSOR KING OF BABYLON SMOTE, thus saith the Lord;   Arise ye, and go up to Kedar, and fill the sons of Kedem. 
29| They shall take their tents and  their sheep, they shall take for themselves their garments, and all their  baggage and their camels; and summon ye destruction against them from every  side. 
30| Flee ye, dig very deep for  a dwelling-place, ye that dwell in the palace; for the king of Babylon has  framed a counsel, and devised a device against you.  
31| Rise up, and go up against a nation  settled <i>and</i> dwelling at ease, who have no doors, nor bolts, nor bars, <i> who</i> dwell alone. 
32| And their  camels shall be a spoil, and the multitude of their cattle shall be destroyed:  and I will scatter them as chaff with every wind, having their hair cut about  their foreheads, I will bring on their overthrow from all sides, saith the Lord. 
33| And the palace shall be a  resting-place for ostriches, and desolate for ever: no man shall abide there,  and no son of man shall dwell there. 
23| CONCERNING DAMASCUS. Emath is brought  to shame, and Arphath: for they have heard an evil report: they are amazed, they  are angry, they shall be utterly unable to rest. 
24|  Damascus is utterly weakened, she is put to flight; trembling has  seized upon her. 
25| How has she not  left my city, they have loved the village? 
26|  Therefore shall the young men fall in thy streets, and all thy  warriors shall fall, saith the Lord. 
27|  And I will kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it shall  devour the streets of the son of Ader. Chapter  31

1|  Thus has the Lord said concerning  MOAB, Woe to Nabau! for it has perished: Cariathaim is taken: Amath and Agath  are put to shame. 
2| There is no  longer any healing for Moab, <i>nor</i> glorying in Esebon: he has devised evils  against her: we have cut her off from <i>being</i> a nation, and she shall be  completely still: after thee shall go a sword; 
3|  for <i>there is</i> a voice of <i>men</i> crying out of Oronaim,  destruction and great ruin. 
4| Moab  is ruined, proclaim <i>it</i> to Zogora: 
5|  for Aloth is filled with weeping: one shall go up weeping by the  way of Oronaim; ye have heard a cry of destruction.  
6| Flee ye, and save your lives, and ye  shall be as a wild ass in the desert. 
7|  Since thou hast trusted in thy strong-hold, therefore thou shalt  be taken: and Chamos shall go forth into captivity, and his priests, and his  princes together. 
8| And destruction  shall come upon every city, it shall by no means escape; the valley also shall  perish, and the plain country shall be completely destroyed, as the Lord has  said. 
9| Set marks upon Moab, for she  shall be touched with a plague-spot, and all her cities shall become desolate;  whence <i>shall there be</i> an inhabitant for her? 
10| Cursed is the man that does the works of the Lord  carelessly, keeping back his sword from blood.  
11| Moab has been at ease from a child,  and trusted in his glory; he has not poured out <i>his liquor</i> from vessel to  vessel, and has not gone into banishment, therefore his taste remained in him,  and his smell departed not. 
12|  Therefore, behold, his days come, saith the Lord, when I shall send upon him bad  leaders, and they shall lead him astray, and they shall utterly break in pieces  his possessions, and shall cut his horns asunder. 
13| And Moab shall be ashamed of Chamos, as the house of  Israel was ashamed of Baethel their hope, having trusted in them.
14| How will ye say, We are strong, and  men strong for war? 
15| Moab is  ruined, <i>even</i> his city, and his choice young men have gone down to  slaughter. 
16| The day of Moab is  near at hand, and his iniquity moves swiftly <i>to vengeance</i>.  
17| Shake <i>the head</i> at him, all ye  that are round about him; all <i>of you</i> utter his name; say ye, How is the  glorious staff broken to pieces, the rod of magnificence!  
18| Come down from <i>thy</i> glory, and  sit down in a damp place: Daebon shall be broken, because Moab is destroyed:  there has gone up against thee one to ravage thy strong-hold.  
19|  Stand by the way, and look, thou that  dwellest in Arer; and ask him that is fleeing, and him that escapes, and say,  What has happened?  
20| Moab is put to shame, because he is  broken: howl and cry; proclaim in Arnon, that Moab has perished.  
21| And judgment is coming against the land  of Misor, upon Chelon, and Rephas, and Mophas, 
22|  and upon Daebon, and upon Nabau, and upon the house of  Daethlathaim, 
23|  and upon  Cariathaim, and upon the house of Gaemol, and upon the house of Maon,  
24| and upon Carioth, and upon Bosor, and  upon all the cities of Moab, far and near. 
25|  The horn of Moab is broken, and his arm is crushed.  
26| Make ye him drunk; for he has  magnified himself against the Lord: and Moab shall clap with his hand, and shall  be also himself a laughing-stock. 
27|  For surely Israel was to thee a laughing-stock, and was found  among thy thefts, because thou didst fight against him. 
28|   The inhabitants of Moab have left the cities, and dwelt in rocks; they have  become as doves nestling in rocks, at the mouth of a cave.  
29| And I have heard of the pride of  Moab, he has greatly heightened his pride and his haughtiness, and his heart has  been lifted up. 
30| But I know his  works: is it not enough for him? has he not done thus?  
31| Therefore howl ye for Moab on all  sides; cry out against the shorn men <i>in</i> a gloomy place. I will weep for  thee, 
32| O vine of Aserema, as with  the weeping of Jazer: thy branches are gone over the sea, they reached the  cities of Jazer: destruction has come upon thy fruits, <i>and</i> upon thy  grape-gatherers. 
33| Joy and gladness  have been utterly swept off the land of Moab: and <i>though</i> there was wine  in thy presses, in the morning they trod it not, neither in the evening did they  raise the cry of joy. 
34| From the  cry of Esebon even to Ætam their cities uttered their voice, from Zogor to  Oronaim, and their tidings <i>as</i> a heifer of three years old, for the water  also of Nebrin shall be dried up.  
35| And I will destroy Moab, saith the  Lord, as he comes up to the altar, and burns incense to his gods.  
36| Therefore the heart of Moab shall sound  as pipes, my heart shall sound as a pipe for the shorn men; forasmuch as what <i> every</i> man has gained has perished from him. 
37|  They shall all have their heads shaved in every place, and every  beard shall be shaved; and all hands shall beat <i>the breasts</i>, and on all  loins shall be sackcloth. 
38| And on  all the housetops of Moab, and in his streets <i>shall be mourning</i>: for I  have broken <i>him</i>, saith the Lord, as a vessel, which is useless.  
39| How has he changed! how has Moab turned <i>his</i> back! Moab is put to shame, and become a laughing-stock, and an  object of anger to all that are round about him.  
40| For thus said the Lord;  
41| Carioth is taken, and the strong-holds  have been taken together. 
42| And  Moab shall perish from being a multitude, because he has magnified himself  against the Lord. 
43| A snare, and  fear, and the pit, are upon thee, O inhabitant of Moab. 
44| He that flees from the terror shall fall into the pit, and  he that comes up out of the pit shall even be taken in the snare: for I will  bring these things upon Moab in the year of their visitation.  Chapter  32

15|  Thus said the Lord God of Israel;  Take the cup of this unmixed wine from mine hand, and thou shalt cause all the  nations to drink, to whom I send thee. 
16|  And they shall drink, and vomit, and be mad, because of the sword  which I send among them.  
17| So I took the cup out of the Lord’s  hand, and caused the nations to whom the Lord sent me to drink:  
18| Jerusalem, and the cities of Juda, and  the kings of Juda, and his princes, to make them a desert place, a desolation,  and a hissing; 
19| and Pharao king of  Egypt, and his servants, and his nobles, and all his people;  
20| and all the mingled <i>people</i>, and  all the kings of the Philistines, and Ascalon, and Gaza, and Accaron, and the  remnant of Azotus, 
21| and Idumea,  and the land of Moab, and the children of Ammon, 
22|  and the kings of Tyre, and the kings of Sidon, and the kings in  the <i>country</i> beyond the sea, 
23|  and Daedan, and Thaeman, and Ros, and every one that is shaved  round about the face, 
24| and all the  mingled <i>people</i> lodging in the wilderness, 
25|  and all the kings of Ælam, and all the kings of the Persians, 
26| and all the kings from the north,  the far and the near, each one with his brother, and all the kingdom s which are  on the face of the earth.  
27| And thou shalt say to them, Thus said  the Lord Almighty; Drink ye, be ye drunken; and ye shall vomit, and shall fall,  and shall in nowise rise, because of the sword which I send among you.  
28| And it shall come to pass, when they  refuse to take the cup out of thine hand, to drink it, that thou shalt say, Thus  said the Lord; Ye shall surely drink. 
29|  For I am beginning to afflict the city whereon my name is called,  and ye shall by no means be held guiltless: for I am calling a sword upon all  that dwell upon the earth.
30| And thou shalt prophesy against them  these words, and shalt say, The Lord shall speak from on high, from his  sanctuary he will utter his voice; he will pronounce a declaration on his place;  and these shall answer like men gathering grapes: and destruction is coming on  them that dwell on the earth, 
31| <i> even</i> upon <i>the extreme</i> part of the earth; for the Lord <i>has</i> a  controversy with the nations, he is pleading with all flesh, and the ungodly are  given to the sword, saith the Lord.  
32| Thus said the Lord; Behold, evils are  proceeding from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind goes forth from the end  of the earth. 
33| And the slain of  the Lord shall be in the day of the Lord from <i>one</i> end of the earth even  to the <i>other</i> end of the earth: they shall not be buried; they shall be as  dung on the face of the earth. 
34|  Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and lament, ye rams of the flock: for your days  have been completed for slaughter, and ye shall fall as the choice rams.  
35| And flight shall perish from the  shepherds, and safety from the rams of the flock. 
36| A voice of the crying of the shepherds, and a moaning of  the sheep and the rams: for the Lord has destroyed their pastures.  
37| And the peaceable abodes that remain  shall be destroyed before the fierceness of my anger. 
38| He has forsaken his lair, as a lion: for their land is  become desolate before the great sword.  Chapter  33

1|  IN THE BEGINNING OF THE REIGN OF  KING JOAKIM SON OF JOSIAS THERE CAME THIS WORD FROM THE LORD.  
2| Thus said the Lord; Stand in the court  of the Lord’s house, and thou shalt declare to all the Jews, and to all that  come to worship in the house of the Lord, all the words which I commanded thee  to speak to them; abate not one word. 
3|  Peradventure they will hear, and turn every one from his evil  way: then I will cease from the evils which I purpose to do to them, because of  their evil practices. 
4| And thou  shalt say, Thus said the Lord; If ye will not hearken to me, to walk in my  statutes which I set before you, 
5|  to hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I send to you early in  the morning; yea, I sent them, but ye hearkened not to me;  
6| then will I make this house as Selo, and  I will make <i>this</i> city a curse to all the nations of all the earth.
7| And the priests, and the false  prophets, and all the people heard Jeremias speaking these words in the house of  the Lord. 
8| And it came to pass,  when Jeremias had ceased speaking all that the Lord had ordered him to speak to  all the people, that the priests and the false prophets and all the people took  him, saying, 
9| Thou shalt surely  die, because thou hast prophesied in the name of the Lord, saying, This house  shall be as Selo, and this city shall be made quite destitute of inhabitants.  And all the people assembled against Jeremias in the house of  the Lord. 
10| And the princes of Juda  heard this word, and they went up out of the house of the king to the house of  the Lord, and sat in the entrance of the new gate. 
11| Then the priests and the false prophets said to the  princes and to all the people, The judgment of death <i>is due</i> to this man;  because he has prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears.  
12| Then Jeremias spoke to the princes,  and to all the people, saying, The Lord sent me to prophesy against this house  and against this city, all the words which ye have heard. 
 13| And now amend your ways and your works, and hearken to  the voice of the Lord; and the Lord shall cease from the evils which he has  pronounced against you. 
14| And  behold, I am in your hands; do to me as is expedient, and as it is best for you. 
15| But know for a certainty, that if  ye slay me, ye bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this city, and  upon them that dwell in it; for in truth the Lord has sent me to you to speak in  your ears all these words.
16| Then the princes and all the people  said to the priests and to the false prophets; Judgment of death is not <i>due</i>  to this man; for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.  
17| And there rose up men of the elders of  the land, and said to all the assembly of the people, 
18| Michaeas the Morathite lived in the days of Ezekias king  of Juda, and said to all the people of Juda, Thus saith the Lord; Sion shall be  ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall become a desolation, and the mountain  of the house shall be a thicket of trees. 
19|  Did Ezekias and all Juda in any way slay him? Was it not that  they feared the Lord, and they made supplication before the Lord, and the Lord  ceased from the evils which he <i>had</i> pronounced against them? whereas we  have wrought great evil against our own souls.  
20| And there was <i>another</i> man  prophesying in the name of the Lord, Urias the son of Samaeas of Cariathiarim;  and he prophesied concerning this land according to all the words of Jeremias. 
21| And king Joakim and all the  princes heard all his words, and sought to slay him; and Urias heard <i>it</i>  and went into Egypt. 
22| And the king  sent men into Egypt; 
23| and they  brought him thence, and brought him into the king; and he smote him with the  sword, and cast him into the sepulchre of the children of his people.  
24| Nevertheless the hand of Achicam son of  Saphan was with Jeremias, to prevent his being delivered into the hands of the  people, or being killed.  Chapter  34  

#34
1| Thus said the Lord; Make to thyself  bonds and yokes, and put <i>them</i> about thy neck, 
3|   and thou shalt send them to the king of Idumea, and to the king of Moab, and to  the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of  Sidon, by the hands of their messengers that come to meet them at Jerusalem to  Sedekias king of Juda. 
4| And thou  shalt commission them to say to their lords, Thus said the Lord God of Israel;  Thus shall ye say to your lords; 
5| I  have made the earth by my great power, and with my high arm, and I will give it  to whomsoever it shall seem <i>good</i> in mine eyes. 
6| I gave the earth to Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon to  serve him, and the wild beasts of the field to labour for him.  
7 8| And the nation and kingdom, all that  shall not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, with sword and  famine will I visit them, saith the Lord, until they are consumed by his hand.  
9| And hearken ye not to your false  prophets, nor to them that divine to you, nor to them that foretell events by  dreams to you, nor to your auguries, nor your sorcerers, that say, Ye shall by  no means work for the king of Babylon: 
10|  for they prophesy lies to you, to remove you far from your land. 
11| But the nation which shall put  its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, I will even leave  it upon its land, and it shall serve him, and dwell in it.
12| I spoke also to Sedekias king of Juda  according to all these words, saying, Put your neck into <i>the yoke</i>, and  serve the king of Babylon. 
13 14| For  they prophesy unrighteous <i>words</i> to you, 
15|   for I sent them not, saith the Lord; and they prophesy <i>in</i> my name  unjustly, that I might destroy you, and ye should perish, and your prophets, who  unrighteously prophesy lies to you.  
16| I spoke to you, and to all this  people, and to the priests, saying, Thus said the Lord; Hearken not to the words  of the prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the Lord’s  house shall return from Babylon: for they prophesy to you unrighteous <i>words</i>. 
17|  I sent them not.  
18| If they are prophets, and if the word of  the Lord is in them, let them meet me, for thus has the Lord said.  
19| And as for the remaining vessels, 
20| which the king of Babylon took  not, when he carried Jechonias prisoner out of Jerusalem, 
 21 22| they shall go into Babylon, saith the Lord.  Chapter  35  

#35
1|  And it came to pass in the fourth  year of Sedekias king of Juda, in the fifth month, <i>that</i> Ananias the false  prophet, the son of Azor, from Gabaon, spoke to me in the house of the Lord, in  the sight of the priests and all the people, saying, 
2| Thus saith the Lord; I have broken the yoke of the king of  Babylon. 
3| Yet two full years, and I  will return into this place the vessels of the house of the Lord,  
4| and Jechonias, and the captivity of Juda:  for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon.  
5| Then Jeremias spoke to Ananias in the  sight of all the people, and in the sight of the priests that stood in the house  of the Lord, 
6| and Jeremias said,  May the Lord indeed do thus; may he confirm thy word which thou dost prophesy,  to return the vessels of the house of the Lord, and all the captivity, out of  Babylon to this place. 
7|  Nevertheless hear ye the word of the Lord which I speak in your ears, and in the  ears of all the people. 
8| The  prophets that were before me and before you of old, also prophesied over much  country, and against great kingdoms, concerning war. 
9| <i>As for</i> the prophet that has prophesied for peace,  when the word has come <i>to pass</i>, they shall know the prophet whom the Lord  has sent them in truth.
10| Then Ananias took the yokes from the  neck of Jeremias in the sight of all the people, and broke them to pieces. 
11| And Ananias spoke in the presence  of all the people, saying, Thus said the Lord; Thus will I break the yoke of the  king of Babylon from the necks of all the nations. And Jeremias went his way.  
12| And the word of the Lord came to  Jeremias, after that Ananias had broken the yokes off his neck, saying,  
13| Go and speak to Ananias, saying, Thus  saith the Lord; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but I will make instead of  them yokes of iron. 
14| For thus said  the Lord, I have put a yoke of iron on the neck of all the nations, that they  may serve the king of Babylon. 
15|   And Jeremias said to Ananias, The Lord has not sent thee; and thou hast caused  this people to trust in unrighteousness. 
16|  Therefore thus said the Lord: Behold, I <i>will</i> cast thee off  from the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die. 
17| So he died in the seventh month.  Chapter  36  

#36
1| And these are the words of the book  which Jeremias sent from Jerusalem to the elders of the captivity, and to the  priests, and to the false prophets, even an epistle to Babylon for the  captivity, and to all the people; 
2|  (after the departure of Jechonias the king and the queen, and the eunuchs, and  every freeman, and bondman, and artificer, out of Jerusalem;)  
3| by the hand of Eleasan son of Saphan, and  Gamarias son of Chelcias, (whom Sedekias king of Juda sent to the king of  Babylon to Babylon) saying, 
4| Thus  said the Lord God of Israel concerning the captivity which I caused to be  carried away from Jerusalem;  
5| Build ye houses, and inhabit <i>them</i>;  and plant gardens, and eat the fruits thereof; 
6|  and take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives  for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, and be multiplied, and be  not diminished. 
7| And seek the peace  of the land into which I have carried you captive, and ye shall pray to the Lord  for the people: for in its peace ye shall <i>have</i> peace.  
8| For thus saith the Lord; Let not the  false prophets that are among you persuade you, and let not your diviners  persuade you, and hearken not to your dreams which ye dream.  
9| For they prophesy to you unrighteous <i> words</i> in my name; and I sent them not. 
10|  For thus said the Lord; When seventy years shall be on the point  of being accomplished at Babylon, I will visit you, and will confirm my words to  you, to bring back your people to this place. 
11|  And I will devise for you a device of peace, and not evil, to  bestow upon you these <i>good things</i>. 
12|  And do ye pray to me, and I will hearken to you: and do ye  earnestly seek me, and ye shall find me; 
13|  for ye shall seek me with your whole heart.  
14| And I will appear to you:  
15|  whereas ye said, The Lord has appointed  for us prophets in Babylon:  
21| Thus saith the Lord concerning  Achiab, and concerning Sedekias; Behold, I <i>will</i> deliver them into the  hands of the king of Babylon; and he shall smite them in your sight.  
22|  And they shall make of them a curse in  all the captivity of Juda in Babylon, saying, The Lord do to thee as he did to  Sedekias, and as he did to Achiab, whom the king of Babylon fried in the fire; 
23| because of the iniquity which  they wrought in Israel, and <i>because</i> they committed adultery with the  wives of their fellow-citizens; and spoke a word in my name, which I did not  command them <i>to speak</i>, and I am witness, saith the Lord.
24| And to Samaeas the Ælamite thou shalt  say, 
25| I sent thee not in my name:  and to Sophonias the priest the son of Maasaeas say thou, 
 26| The Lord has made thee priest in the place of Jodae the  priest, to be ruler in the house of the Lord over every prophet, and to every  madman, and thou shalt put them in prison, and into the dungeon.  
27| And now wherefore have ye reviled  together Jeremias of Anathoth, who prophesied to you? 
28| Did he not send for this purpose? for in the course of  this month he sent to you to Babylon, saying, It is far off: build ye houses,  and inhabit <i>them</i>; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them.  
29| And Sophonias read the book in the ears  of Jeremias.  
30| Then the word of the Lord came to  Jeremias, saying, 
31| Send to the  captivity, saying, Thus saith the Lord concerning Samaeas the Ælamite, Since  Samaeas has prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he has made you to trust  in iniquity, 
32| therefore thus saith  the Lord; Behold, I will visit Samaeas, and his family: and there shall not be a  man of them in the midst of you to see the good which I will do to you: they  shall not see <i>it</i>.  Chapter  37

1| THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS FROM  THE LORD, SAYING, 
2| Thus speaks the  Lord God of Israel, saying, Write all the words which I have spoken to thee in a book. 
3| For, behold, the days come, saith  the Lord, when I will bring back the captivity of my people Israel and Juda,  said the Lord: and I will bring them back to the land which I gave to their  fathers, and they shall be lords of it.  
4| AND THESE ARE THE WORDS WHICH THE LORD  SPOKE CONCERNING ISRAEL AND JUDA;  
5| Thus said the Lord: Ye shall hear a  sound of fear, <i>there is</i> fear, and there is not peace.  
6|  Enquire, and see if a male has born a  child? and <i>ask</i> concerning the fear, wherein they shall hold their loins,  and <i>look for</i> safety: for I have seen every man, and his hands are on his  loins; <i>their</i> faces are turned to paleness. 
7|  For that day is great, and there is not such <i>another</i>; and  it is a time of straitness to Jacob; but he shall be saved out of it.  
8| In that day, said the Lord, I will break  the yoke off their neck, and will burst their bonds, and they shall no longer  serve strangers: 
9| but they shall  serve the Lord their God; and I will raise up to them David their king.
10 11 12| Thus saith the Lord; I have  brought on <i>thee</i> destruction; thy stroke is painful.  
13|  There is none to judge thy cause: thou  hast been painfully treated for healing, there is no help for thee.  
14| All thy friends have forgotten thee;  they shall not ask <i>about thee</i> at all, for I have smitten thee with he  stroke of an enemy, <i>even</i> severe correction: thy sins have abounded above  all thine iniquity. 
15| Thy sins have  abounded beyond the multitude of thine iniquities, <i>therefore</i> they have  done these things to thee. Therefore all that devour thee shall be eaten, and  all thine enemies shall eat all their <i>own</i> flesh. 
16| And they that spoil thee shall become a spoil, and I will  give up to be plundered all that have plundered thee. 
17| For I will bring about thy healing, I will heal thee of  thy grievous wound, saith the Lord; for thou art called Dispersed: she is your  prey, for no one seeks after her.
18| Thus said the Lord; Behold, I will  turn the captivity of Jacob, and will have pity upon his prisoners; and the city  shall be built upon her hill, and the people shall settle after their manner. 
19| And there shall go forth from  them singers, <i>even</i> the sound of men making merry: and I will multiply  them, and they shall not at all be diminished. 
20|  And their sons shall go in as before, and their testimonies shall  be established before me, and I will visit them that afflict them.  
21| And their mighty ones shall be over  them, and their prince shall proceed of themselves; and I will gather them, and  they shall return to me: for who is this that has set his heart to return to me?  saith the Lord.  
23| For the wrathful anger of the lord  has gone forth, <i>even</i> a whirlwind of anger has gone forth: it shall come  upon the ungodly. 
24| The fierce  anger of the Lord shall not return, until he shall execute <i>it</i>, and until  he shall establish the purpose of his heart: in the latter days ye shall know  these things.  Chapter  38  

#38
1| At that time, saith the Lord, I  will be a God to the family of Israel, and they shall be to me a people.  
2| Thus saith the Lord, I found him warm in  the wilderness with them that were slain with the sword: go ye and destroy not  Israel. 
3| The Lord appeared to him  from afar, <i>saying</i>, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore  have I drawn thee in compassion. 
4|  For I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel: thou shalt  yet take thy timbrel, and go forth with the party of them that make merry. 
5| For ye have planted vineyards on  the mountains of Samaria: plant ye, and praise. 
6|  For it is a day when those that plead on the mountains of Ephraim  shall call, <i>saying</i>, Arise ye, and go up to Sion to the Lord your God.  
7| For thus saith the Lord to Jacob;  Rejoice ye, and exult over the head of the nations: make proclamation, and  praise ye: say, The Lord has delivered his people, the remnant of Israel.  
8|  Behold, I bring them from the north, and  will gather them from the end of the earth to the feast of the passover: and <i> the people</i> shall beget a great multitude, and they shall return hither. 
9|  They went forth with weeping, and  I will bring them back with consolation, causing them to lodge by the channels  of waters in a straight way, and they shall not err in it: for I am become a  father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born.
10| Hear the words of the Lord, ye  nations, and proclaim <i>them</i> to the islands afar off; say, He that  scattered Israel will also gather him, and keep him as one that feeds his flock. 
11| For the Lord has ransomed Jacob,  he has rescued him out of the hand of them <i>that were</i> stronger than he. 
12| And they shall come, and shall  rejoice in the mount of Sion, and shall come to the good things of the Lord, <i> even</i> to a land of corn, and wine, and fruits, and cattle, and sheep: and  their soul shall be as a fruitful tree; and they shall hunger no more.  
13| Then shall the virgins rejoice in the  assembly of youth, and the old men shall rejoice; and I will turn their mourning  into joy, and will make them merry. 
14|  I will expand and cheer with wine the soul of the priests the  sons of Levi, and my people shall be satisfied with my good things: thus saith  the Lord.  
15| A voice was heard in Rama, of  lamentation, and of weeping, and wailing; Rachel would not cease weeping for her  children, because they are not.  
16| Thus saith the Lord; Let thy voice  cease from weeping, and thine eyes from thy tears: for their is a reward for thy  works; and they shall return from the land of <i>thine</i> enemies.  
17| <i>There shall be</i> an abiding <i>home</i>  for thy children.
18| I have heard the sound of Ephraim  lamenting, <i>and saying</i>, Thou hast chastened me, and I was chastened; I as  a calf was not <i>willingly</i> taught: turn thou me, and I shall turn; for thou <i>art</i> the Lord my God. 
19| For  after my captivity I repented; and after I knew, I groaned for the day of shame,  and shewed thee that I bore reproach from my youth. 
20| Ephraim is a beloved son, a pleasing child to me: for  because my words are in him, I will surely remember him: therefore I made haste <i>to help</i> him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the Lord.   
21| Prepare thyself, O Sion; execute  vengeance; look to thy ways: return, O virgin of Israel, by the way by which  thou wentest, return mourning to thy cities. 
22|  How long, O disgraced daughter, wilt thou turn away? for the Lord  has created safety for a new plantation: men shall go about in safety.   
23| For thus saith the Lord; They shall  yet speak this word in the land of Juda, and in the cities thereof, when I shall  turn his captivity; blessed be the Lord on his righteous holy mountain!  
24| And there shall be dwellers in the  cities of Juda, and in all his land, together with the husbandman, and <i>the  shepherd</i> shall go forth with the flock. 
25|  For I have saturated every thirsting soul, and filled every  hungry soul. 
26| Therefore I awake,  and beheld; and my sleep was sweet to me.
27| Therefore, behold, the days come,  saith the Lord, when I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Juda with  the seed of man, and the seed of beast. 
28|  And it shall come to pass, that as I watched over them, to pull  down, and to afflict, so will I watch over them, to build, and to plant, saith  the Lord. 
29| In those days they  shall certainly not say, The fathers ate a sour grape, and the children’s teeth  were set on edge. 
30| But every one  shall die in his own sin; and the teeth of him that eats the sour grape shall be  set on edge.  
31| Behold, the days come, saith the  Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the  house of Juda: 
32| not according to  the covenant which I made with their fathers in the day when I took hold of  their hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; for they abode not in my  covenant, and I disregarded them, saith the Lord. 
33| For this is my covenant which I will make with the house  of Israel; after those days, saith the Lord, I will surely put my laws into  their mind, and write them on their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and  they shall be to me a people. 
34| And  they shall not at all teach every one his <i>fellow</i> citizen, and every one  his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me, from the least of  them to the greatest of them: for I will be merciful to their iniquities, and  their sins I will remember no more. 
35|   Thus saith the Lord, who gives the sun for a light by day, the moon and the  stars for a light by night, and <i>makes</i> a roaring in the sea, so that the  waves thereof roar; the Lord Almighty is his name: 
36| if these ordinances cease from before me, saith the Lord,  then shall the family of Israel cease to be a nation before me forever.   
37| Though the sky should be raised to a <i>greater</i> height, saith the Lord, and though the ground of the earth should  be sunk <i>lower</i> beneath, yet I will not cast off the family of Israel,  saith the Lord, for all that they have done.  
38| Behold, the days come, saith the  Lord, when the city shall be built to the Lord from the tower of Anameel to the  gate of the corner. 
39| And the  measurement of it shall proceed in front of them as far as the hills of Gareb,  and it shall be compassed with a circular wall of choice stones.  
40| And all the Asaremoth even to Nachal  Kedron, as far as the corner of the horse-gate eastward, shall be holiness to  the Lord; and it shall not fail any more, and shall not be destroyed for ever. Chapter  39

1| The word that came from the Lord to  Jeremias in the tenth year of king Sedekias, this is the eighteenth year of king  Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon.  
2| And the host of the king of Babylon  had made a rampart against Jerusalem: and Jeremias was kept in the court of the  prison, which is in the king’s house; 
3|  in which king Sedekias <i>had</i> shut him up, saying, Wherefore  dost thou prophesy, saying, Thus saith the Lord, Behold, I <i>will</i> give this  city into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it;  
4| and Sedekias shall by no means be  delivered out of the hand of the Chaldeans, for he shall certainly be given up  into the hands of the king of Babylon, and his mouth shall speak to his mouth,  and his eyes shall look upon his eyes; 
5|  and Sedekias shall go into Babylon, and dwell there?  
6| AND THE WORD OF THE LORD CAME TO  JEREMIAS, SAYING, 
7| Behold, Anameel  the son of Salom thy father’s brother is coming to thee, saying, Buy thee my  field that is in Anathoth: for thou <i>hast</i> the right to take <i>it</i> as a  purchase.  
8| So Anameel the son of Salom my  father’s brother came to me into the court of the prison, and said, Buy thee my  field that is in the land of Benjamin, in Anathoth: for thou <i>hast</i> a right  to buy it, and thou art the elder. So I knew that it was the word of the Lord. 
9| And I bought the field of Anameel  the son of my father’s brother, and I weighed him seventeen shekels of silver. 
10| And I wrote <i>it</i> in a book,  and sealed <i>it</i>, and took the testimony of witnesses, and weighed the money  in the balance. 
11| And I took the  book of the purchase that was sealed; 
12|  and I gave it to Baruch son of Nerias, son of Maasaeas, in the  sight of Anameel my father’s brother’s son, and in the sight of the men that  stood by and wrote in the book of the purchase, and in the sight of the Jews  that were in the court of the prison. 
13|  And I charged Baruch in their presence, saying, Thus saith the  Lord Almighty; 
14| Take this book of  the purchase, and the book that has been read; and thou shalt put it into an  earthen vessel, that it may remain many days. 
15|  For thus saith the Lord; There shall yet be bought fields and  houses and vineyards in this land.
16| And I prayed to the Lord after I had  given the book of the purchase to Baruch the son of Nerias, saying,  
17| O <i>ever</i> living Lord! thou hast  made the heaven and the earth by thy great power, and with thy high and lofty  arm: nothing can be hidden from thee. 
18|  Granting mercy to thousands, and recompensing the sins of the  fathers into the bosoms of their children after them: the great, the strong God; 
19| the Lord of great counsel, and  mighty in deeds, the great Almighty God, and Lord of great name: thine eyes are  upon the ways of the children of men, to give to every one according to his way: 
20| who hast wrought signs and  wonders in the land of Egypt even to this day, and in Israel, and among the  inhabitants of the earth; and thou didst make for thyself a name, as at this  day; 
21| and thou didst bring out thy  people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, with a  mighty hand, and with a high arm, and with great sights; 
 22|  and thou gavest them this land, which thou didst swear <i>to give</i> to their fathers, a land flowing with milk and honey;  
23| and they went in, and took it; but they  hearkened not to thy voice, and walked not in thine ordinances; they did none of  the things which thou didst command them, and they caused all these calamities  to happen to them. 
24| Behold, a  multitude is come against the city to take it; and the city is given into the  hands of the Chaldeans that fight against it, by the power of the sword, and the  famine: as thou hast spoken, so has it happened. 
25|  And thou sayest to me, Buy thee the field for money; and I wrote  a book, and sealed <i>it</i>, and took the testimony of witnesses: and the city  is given into the hands of the Chaldeans.
26| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying,  
27| I am the Lord, the God of all flesh:  shall anything be hidden from me! 
28|  Therefore thus saith the Lord God of Israel; This city shall  certainly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take  it: 
29| and the Chaldeans shall come  to war against this city, and they shall burn this city with fire, and shall  burn down the houses wherein they burnt incense on the roofs thereof to Baal,  and poured drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me. 
 30| For the children of Israel and the children of Juda  alone did evil in my sight from their youth. 
31|  For this city was <i>obnoxious</i> to my anger and my wrath, from  the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from my  presence, 
32| because of all the  wickedness of the children of Israel and Juda, which they wrought to provoke me,  they and their kings, and their princes, and their priests, and their prophets,  the men of Juda, and the dwellers in Jerusalem. 
33|  And they turned the back to me, and not the face: whereas I  taught them early in the morning, but they hearkened no more to receive  instructions. 
34| And they set their  pollutions in the house, on which my name was called, by their uncleannesses. 
35| And they built to Baal the altars  that are in the valley of the son of Ennom, to offer their sons and their  daughters to king Moloch; which things I commanded them not, neither came it  into my mind that they should do this abomination, to cause Juda to sin.   
36| And now thus has the Lord God of  Israel said concerning this city, of which thou sayest, it shall be delivered  into the hands of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by famine, and  banishment. 
37| Behold, I <i>will</i>  gather them out of every land, where I have scattered them in my anger, and my  wrath, and great fury; and I will bring them back into this place, and will  cause them to dwell safely: 
38| and  they shall be to me a people, and I will be to them a god.  
39| And I will give them another way, and  another heart, to fear me continually, and <i>that</i> for good to them and  their children after them. 
40| And I  will make with them an everlasting covenant, which I will by no means turn away  from them, and I will put my fear into their heart, that they may not depart  from me. 
41| And I will visit <i>them</i>  to do them good, and I will plant them in this land in faithfulness, and with  all my heart, and with all <i>my</i> soul.  
42| For thus saith the Lord; As I have  brought upon this people all these great evils, so will I bring upon them all  the good things which I pronounced upon them. 
43|  And there shall yet be fields bought in the land, of which thou  sayest, it shall be destitute of man and beast; and they are delivered into the  hands of the Chaldeans. 
44| And they  shall buy fields for money, and thou shalt write a book, and seal <i>it</i>, and  shalt take the testimony of witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and round about  Jerusalem, and in the cities of Juda, and in the cities of the mountain, and in  the cities of the plain, and in the cities of the south: for I will turn their  captivity.  Chapter  40

1| And the word of the Lord came to  Jeremias the second time, when he was yet bound in the court of the prison,  saying,  
2| Thus saith the Lord, who made the  earth and formed it, to establish it; the Lord is his name;  
3| Cry to me, and I will answer thee, and I  will declare to thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not.  
4| For thus saith the Lord concerning the  houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the king of Juda, which have  been pulled down for mounds and fortifications, 
5|  to fight against the Chaldeans, and to fill it with the corpses  of men, whom I smote in mine anger and my wrath, and turned away my face from  them, for all their wickedness: 
6|  Behold, I bring upon her healing and cure, and I will show <i>myself</i> to  them, and will heal her, and make both peace and security.  
7| And I will turn the captivity of Juda,  and the captivity of Israel, and will build them, even as before.  
8| And I will cleanse them from all their  iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and will not remember their  sins, whereby they have sinned against me, and revolted from me.  
9|  And it shall be for joy and praise, and  for glory to all the people of the earth, who shall hear all the good that I  will do: and they shall fear and be provoked for all the good things and for all  the peace which I will bring upon them.
10| Thus saith the Lord; There shall yet  be heard in this place, of which ye say, it is destitute of men and cattle, in  the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, <i>the places</i> that have  been made desolate for want of men and cattle, 
11|  the voice of gladness, and the voice of joy, the voice of the  bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of men saying, Give thanks to  the Lord Almighty: for the Lord is good; for his mercy <i>endures</i> fore ever:  and they shall bring gifts into the house of the Lord; for I will turn all the  captivity of that land as before, said the Lord. 
12|  Thus saith the Lord of hosts; There shall yet be in this place,  that is desert for want of man and beast, in all the cities thereof,  resting-places for shepherds causing their flocks to lie down.  
13| In the cities of the hill country, and  in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of  Benjamin, and in the <i>cities</i> round about Jerusalem, and in the cities of  Juda, flocks shall yet pass under the hand of him that numbers <i>them</i>,  saith the Lord.  Chapter  41

1| The word that came to  Jeremias from the Lord (now Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and all his army,  and all the country of his dominion, were warring against Jerusalem, and against  all the cities of Juda,) saying,  
2| Thus has the Lord said; Go to Sedekias  king of Juda, and thou shalt say to him, Thus has the Lord said, This city shall  certainly be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon, and he shall take  it, and shall burn it with fire: 
3|  and thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt certainly be taken, and  shalt be given into his hands; and thine eyes shall see his eyes, and thou shalt  enter into Babylon.  
4| But hear the word of the Lord, O  Sedekias king of Juda; Thus saith the Lord, 
5|  Thou shalt die in peace: and as they wept for thy fathers that  reigned before thee, they shall weep also for thee, <i>saying</i>, Ah lord! and  they shall lament for thee down to the grave: for I have spoken the word, said  the Lord.  
6| And Jeremias spoke to king Sedekias  all these words in Jerusalem. 
7| And  the host of the king of Babylon warred against Jerusalem, and against the cities  of Juda, and against Lachis, and against Azeca: for these strong cities were  left among the cities of Juda.
8| The word that came from the Lord to  Jeremias, after king Sedekias had concluded a covenant with the people, to  proclaim a release; 
9| That every one  should set at liberty his servant, and every one has handmaid, the Hebrew man  and Hebrew woman, that no man of Juda should be a bondman.  
10| Then all the nobles, and all the people  who had entered into the covenant, <i>engaging</i> to set free every one his  man-servant, and every one his maid, turned, 
11|   and gave them over to be men-servants and maid-servants.  
12| And the word of the Lord came to  Jeremias, saying, 
13| Thus saith the  Lord; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day wherein I took them out of  the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying, 
14| When six years are accomplished, thou shalt set free thy  brother the Hebrew, who shall be sold to thee: for he shall serve thee six  years, and <i>then</i> thou shalt let him go free: but they hearkened not to me,  and inclined not their ear. 
15| And  this day they turned to do that which was right in my sight, to proclaim every  one the release of his neighbour; and they had concluded a covenant before me,  in the house whereon my name is called. 
16|  But ye turned and profaned my name, to bring back every one his  servant, and every one his handmaid, whom ye had sent forth free <i>and</i> at  their own disposal, to be to you men-servants and maid-servants.  
17| Therefore thus said the Lord; Ye have  not hearkened to me, to proclaim a release every one to his neighbour: behold, I  proclaim a release to you, to the sword, and to the pestilence, and to the  famine; and I will give you up to dispersion <i>among</i> all the kingdoms of  the earth. 
18|  And I will give the  men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not kept my covenant, which  they made before me, the calf which they prepared to sacrifice with it,  
19| the princes of Juda, and the men in  power, and the priests, and the people; 
20|  I will even give them to their enemies, and their carcases shall  be food for the birds of the sky and for the wild beasts of the earth.  
21| And I will give Sedekias king of Judea,  and their princes, into the hands of their enemies, and the host of the king of  Babylon <i>shall come upon</i> them that run away from them.  
22|  Behold, I <i>will</i> give command,  saith the Lord, and will bring them back to this land; and they shall fight  against it, and take it, and burn it with fire, and the cities of Juda; and I  will make them desolate without inhabitants.  Chapter  42

1| THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS from  the Lord in the days of Joakim, king of Juda, saying, 
2| Go to the house of the Archabin, and thou shalt bring them  to the house of the Lord, into one of the courts, and give them wine to drink.  
3| So I brought forth Jechonias the son  of Jeremin the son of Chabasin, and his brethren, and his sons, and all the  family of the Archabin; 
4| and I  brought them into the house of the Lord, into the chamber of the sons of Joanan,  the son of Ananias, the son of Godolias, a man of God, who dwells near the house  of the princes that are over the house of Maasaeas the son of Selom, who kept  the court. 
5| And I set before them a  jar of wine, and cups, and I said, Drink ye wine.  
6| But they said, We will on no account  drink wine, for our father Jonadab the son of Rechab commanded us, saying, Ye  shall on no account drink wine, <i>neither</i> ye, nor your sons for ever: 
7|  nor shall ye at all build houses,  nor sow any seed, nor shall ye have a vineyard: for ye shall dwell in tents all  your days; that ye may live many days upon the land, in which ye sojourn.  
8|  And we hearkened to the voice of Jonadab  our father, so as to drink no wine all our days, we, and our wives, and our  sons, and our daughters; 
9| and so as  to build no houses to dwell in: and we have had no vineyard, nor field, nor  seed: 
10| but we have dwelt in tents,  and have hearkened, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded  us. 
11| And it came to pass, when  Nabuchodonosor came up against the land, that we said we would come in; and we  entered into Jerusalem, for fear of the host of the Chaldeans, and for fear of  the host of the Assyrians: and we dwelt there.
12| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying, 
13| Thus saith the Lord, Go,  and say to the men of Juda, and to them that dwell in Jerusalem, Will ye not  receive correction to hearken to my words? 
14|  The sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the word which he  commanded his children, that they should drink no wine; and they have not drunk <i>it</i>: but I spoke to you early, and ye hearkened not.  
15| And I sent to you my servants the  prophets, saying, Turn ye every one from his evil way, and amend your practices,  and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell upon the land  which I gave to you and to your fathers: but ye inclined not your ears, and  hearkened not. 
16| But the sons of  Jonadab the son of Rechab have kept the command of their father; but this people  has not hearkened to me. 
17|  Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> bring upon Juda and upon  the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evils which I pronounced against them.  
18| Therefore thus saith the Lord; Since  the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have hearkened to the command of their  father, to do as their father commanded them: 
19|  there shall never be wanting a man of the sons of Jonadab the son  of Rechab to stand before my face while the earth remains.  Chapter  43

1| IN THE FOURTH YEAR OF JOAKIM son of  Josias king of Juda, the word of the Lord came to me, saying,  
2| Take thee a roll of a book, and write  upon it all the words which I spoke to thee against Jerusalem, and against Juda,  and against all the nations, from the day when I spoke to thee, from the days of  Josias king of Juda, even to this day. 
3|  Perhaps the house of Juda will hear all the evils which I purpose  to do to them; that they may turn from their evil way; and <i>so</i> I will be  merciful to their iniquities and their sins.  
4| So Jeremias called Baruch the son of  Nerias: and he wrote from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the Lord, which  he had spoken to him, on a roll of a book. 
5|  And Jeremias commanded Baruch, saying, I am in prison; I cannot  enter into the house of the Lord: 
6|  so thou shalt read in this roll in the ears of the people in the house of the  Lord, on the fast day; and in the ears of all Juda that come out of their  cities, thou shalt read to them. 
7|  Peradventure their supplication will come before the Lord, and they will turn  from their evil way: for great is the wrath and the anger of the Lord, which he  has pronounced against this people.  
8| And Baruch did according to all that  Jeremias commanded him—reading in the book the words of the Lord in the Lord’s  house. 
9| And it came to pass in the  eighth year of king Joakim, in the ninth month, all the people in Jerusalem, and  the house of Juda, proclaimed a fast before the Lord. 
10| And Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremias in the  house of the Lord, in the house of Gamarias son of Saphan the scribe, in the  upper court, in the entrance of the new gate of the house of the Lord, and in  the ears of all the people.  
11| And Michaeas the son of Gamarias the  son of Saphan heard all the words of the Lord, out of the book.  
12| And he went down to the king’s house,  into the house of the scribe: and, behold, there were sitting there all the  princes, Elisama the scribe, and Dalaeas the son of Selemias, and Jonathan the  son of Acchobor, and Gamarias the son of Saphan, and Sedekias the son of  Ananias, and all the princes. 
13| And  Michaeas reported to them all the words which he had heard Baruch reading in the  ears of the people.  
14| And all the princes sent to Baruch  son of Nerias Judin the son of Nathanias, the son of Selemias, the son of Chusi,  saying, Take in thine hand the roll in which thou readest in the ears of the  people, and come. So Baruch took the roll, and went down to them.  
15| And they said to him, Read <i>it</i>  again in our ears. And Baruch read <i>it</i>. 
16|  And it came to pass, when they <i>had</i> heard all the words, <i> that</i> they took counsel each with his neighbour, and said, Let us by all  means tell the king all these words. 
17|  And they asked Baruch, saying, Where didst thou write all these  words? 
18| And Baruch said, Jeremias  told me from his <i>own</i> mouth all these words, and I wrote them in a book. 
19| And they said to Baruch, Go, and  hide, thou and Jeremias; let no man know where ye <i>are</i>.
20| And they went in to the king into the  court, and gave the roll <i>to one</i> to keep in the house of Elisama; and they  told the king all these words. 
21|  And the king sent Judin to fetch the roll: and he took it out of the house of  Elisama: and Judin read in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the  princes who stood round the king. 
22|  Now the king was sitting in the winter house: and <i>there was</i>  a fire on the hearth before him. 
23|  And it came to pass when Judin had read three or four leaves, he cut them off  with a penknife, and cast <i>them</i> into the fire that was on the hearth,  until the whole roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth.  
24| And the king and his servants that heard  all these words sought not <i>the Lord</i>, and rent not their garments.  
25|  But Elnathan and Godolias suggested to  the king that he should burn the roll.  
26| And the king commanded Jeremeel the  king’s son, and Saraeas the son of Esriel, to take Baruch and Jeremias: but they  were hidden.  
27| Then the word of the Lord came to  Jeremias, after the king had burnt the roll, <i>even</i> all the words which  Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremias, saying, 
28|  Again take thou another roll, and write all the words that were  on the roll, which king Joakim has burnt. 
29|  And thou shalt say, Thus saith the Lord; Thou hast burnt this  roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall  certainly come in, and destroy this land, and man and cattle shall fail from off  it?  
30| Therefore thus saith the Lord  concerning Joakim king of Juda; He shall not have <i>a man</i> to sit on the  throne of David: and his carcass shall be cast forth in the heat by day, and in  the frost by night. 
31| And I will  visit him, and his family, and his servants: and I will bring upon him, and upon  the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the land of Juda, all the evils which I  spoke of to them; and they hearkened not.  
32| And Baruch took another roll, and  wrote upon it from the mouth of Jeremias all the words of the book which Joakim  had burnt: and there were yet more words added to it like the former. Chapter  44  

#44
1| And Sedekias the son of Josias  reigned instead of Joakim, whom Nabuchodonosor appointed to reign over Juda. 
2| And he and his servants and the  people of the land hearkened not to the words of the Lord, which he spoke by  Jeremias.  
3| And king Sedekias sent Joachal son of  Selemias and Sophonias the priest son of Maasaeas to Jeremias, saying, Pray now  for us to the Lord. 
4| Now Jeremias  came and went through the midst of the city: for they <i>had</i> not put him  into the house of the prison. 
5| And  the host of Pharao was come forth out of Egypt; and the Chaldeans heard the  report of them, and they went up from Jerusalem.  
6| And the word of the Lord came to  Jeremias, saying, 
7| Thus said the  Lord; Thus shalt thou say to the king of Juda who sent to thee, to seek me;  Behold, the army of Pharao which is come forth to help you: they shall return to  the land of Egypt: 
8| and the  Chaldeans themselves shall turn again, and fight against this city, and take it,  and burn it with fire. 
9| For thus  saith the Lord; Suppose not in your hearts, saying, The Chaldeans will certainly  depart from us: for they shall not depart. 
10|  And though ye should smite the whole host of the Chaldeans that  fight against you, and there should be left a few wounded <i>men</i>, these  should rise up each in his place, and burn this city with fire.
11| And it came to pass, when the host of  the Chaldeans had gone up from Jerusalem for fear of the host of Pharao,  
12| that Jeremias went forth from Jerusalem  to go into the land of Benjamin, to buy thence <i>a property</i> in the midst of  the people. 
13| And he was in the  gate of Benjamin, and <i>there was</i> there a man with whom he lodged, Saruia  the son of Selemias, the son of Ananias; and he caught Jeremias, saying, Thou  art fleeing to the Chaldeans. 
14| And  he said, <i>It is</i> false; I do not flee to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened  not to him; and Saruia caught Jeremias, and brought him to the princes.  
15| And the princes were very angry with  Jeremias, and smote him, and sent him into the house of Jonathan the scribe: for  they had made this a prison.  
16| So Jeremias came into the dungeon,  and into the cells, and he remained there many days. 
17| Then Sedekias sent, and called him; and the king asked him  secretly, saying, Is there a word from the Lord? and he said, There is: thou  shalt be delivered into the hands of the king of Babylon. 
 18| And Jeremias said to the king, Wherein have I wronged  thee, or thy servants, or this people, that thou puttest me in prison?  
19| And where are your prophets who  prophesied to you saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against this land? 
20| Now therefore, my lord the king,  let my supplication come before thy face: and why dost thou send me back to the  house of Jonathan the scribe? and let me not on any account die there.  
21| Then the king commanded, and they cast  him into the prison, and gave him a loaf a day out of the place where they bake,  until the bread failed out of the city. So Jeremias continued in the court of  the prison.  Chapter  45  

#45
1| And Saphanias the son of Nathan,  and Godolias the son of Paschor, and Joachal the son of Semelias, heard the  words which Jeremias spoke to the people, saying,  
2| Thus saith the Lord; He that remains  in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine: but he that goes out to  the Chaldeans shall live; and his soul shall be given him for a found treasure,  and he shall live. 
3| For thus saith  the Lord; This city shall certainly be delivered into the hands of the host of  the king of Babylon, and they shall take it. 
4|  And they said to the king, Let that man, we pray thee, be slain,  for he weakens the hands of the fighting men that are left in the city, and the  hands of all the people, speaking to them according to these words: for this man  does not prophesy peace to this people, but evil. 
5|  Then the king said, Behold, he is in your hands. For the king  could not resist them. 
6| And they  cast him into the dungeon of Melchias the king’s son, which was in the court of  the prison; and they let him down into the pit: and there was no water in the  pit, but mire: and he was in the mire.  
7| And Abdemelech the Ethiopian heard,  (now he was in the king’s household,) that they <i>had</i> put Jeremias into the  dungeon; and the king was in the gate of Benjamin: 
8| and he went forth to him, and spoke to the king and said, 
9| Thou hast done evil in what thou  hast done to slay this man with hunger: for there is no more bread in the city. 
10| And the king commanded  Abdemelech, saying, Take with thee hence thirty men, and bring him up out of the  dungeon, that he die not. 
11| So  Abdemelech took the men and went into the underground <i>part of the</i> king’s  house, and took thence old rags and old ropes, and threw them to Jeremias into  the dungeon. 
12|  And he said, Put  these under the ropes. And Jeremias did so. 
13|  And they drew him with the ropes, and lifted him out of the  dungeon: and Jeremias remained in the court of the prison.
14| Then the king sent, and called him to  himself into the house of Aselisel, which was in the house of the Lord: and the  king said to him, I will ask thee a question, and I pray thee hide nothing from  me.  
15| And Jeremias said to the king, If I  tell thee, wilt thou not certainly put me to death? and if I give thee counsel,  thou wilt not at all hearken to me. 
16|  And the king swore to him, saying, <i>As</i> the Lord lives who  gave us this soul, I will not slay thee, neither will I give thee into the hands  of these men.  
17| And Jeremias said to him, Thus saith  the Lord; If thou wilt indeed go forth to the captains of the king of Babylon,  thy soul shall live, and this city shall certainly not be burnt with fire; and  thou shalt live, and thy house. 
18|  But if thou wilt not go forth this city shall be delivered into the hands of the  Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt by no means escape.  
19| And the king said to Jeremias, I  consider the Jews that have gone over to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me  into their hands, and they mock me.  
20| And Jeremias said, They shall in no  wise deliver thee up. Hear the word of the Lord which I speak to thee; and it  shall be better for thee, and thy soul shall live. 
21| But if thou wilt not go forth, this is the word which the  Lord has shewn me. 
22| And, behold,  all the women that are left in the house of the king of Juda were brought forth  to the princes of the king of Babylon; and they said, The men who were at peace  with thee have deceived thee, and will prevail against thee; and they shall  cause thy foot to slide and fail, they have turned back from thee.  
23| And they shall bring forth thy wives and  thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt by no means escape, for thou shalt  be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city shall be burnt.  
24| Then the king said to him, Let no man  know <i>any</i> of these words, and certainly thou shalt not die.  
25| And if the princes shall hear that I  have spoken to thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Tell us, what said  the king to thee? hide <i>it</i> not from us, and we will in no wise slay thee,  and what said the king to thee? 
26|  Then thou shalt say to them, I brought my supplication before the presence of  the king, that he would not send me back into the house of Jonathan, that I  should die there.  
27| And all the princes came to Jeremias,  and asked him: and he told them according to all these words, which the king had  commanded him. And they were silent, because the word of the Lord was not heard. 
28| And Jeremias remained in the  court of the prison, until the time when Jerusalem was taken. Chapter  46  

#46
1| And it came to pass in the ninth  month of Sedekias king of Juda, <i>that</i> Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came,  and all his host, against Jerusalem, and they besieged it.  
2| And in the eleventh year of Sedekiass, in  the fourth month, on the ninth day of the month, the city was broken <i>up</i>. 
3| And all the leaders of the king of  Babylon went in, and sat in the middle gate, Marganasar, and Samagoth, and  Nabusachar, and Nabusaris, Nagargas, Naserrabamath, and the rest of the leaders  of the king of Babylon, 
4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14|  and they sent, and took Jeremias out of the court of the prison,  and gave him <i>in charge</i> to Godolias the son of Achicam, the son of Saphan:  and they brought him out, and he sat in the midst of the people.  
15| And the word of the Lord came to  Jeremias in the court of the prison, saying, 
16|  Go and say to Abdemelech the Ethiopian, Thus said the Lord God of  Israel; Behold, I <i>will</i> bring my words upon this city for evil, and not  for good. 
17| But I will save thee in  that day, and I will by no means deliver thee into the hands of the men before  whom thou art afraid. 
18| For I will  surely save thee, and thou shalt by no means fall by the sword; and thou shalt  find thy life, because thou didst trust in me, saith the Lord. Chapter  47  

#47
1| The word that came from the Lord to  Jeremias, after that Nabuzardan the captain of the guard had let him go out of  Rama, when he had taken him in manacles in the midst of the captivity of Juda, <i>even</i> those who were carried to Babylon.  
2| And the chief captain of the guard  took him, and said to him, The Lord thy God has pronounced all these evils upon  this place: 
3| and the Lord has done  it; because ye sinned against him, and hearkened not to his voice.  
4| Behold, I have loosed thee from the  manacles that were upon thine hands. If it seem good to thee to go with me to  Babylon, then will I set mine eyes upon thee. 
5|  But if not, depart; return to Godolias the son of Achicam, the  son of Saphan, whom the king of Babylon has appointed governor in the land of  Juda, and dwell with him in the midst of the people in the land of Juda: to  whatsoever places it seems good in thine eyes to go, do thou even go. And the  captain of the guard made him presents, and let him go. 
6|   And he came to Godolias to Massepha, and dwelt in the midst of his people that  was left in the land.
7| And all the leaders of the host that  was in the country, they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had  appointed Godolias <i>governor</i> in the land, and they committed to him the  men and their wives, whom <i>Nabuchodonosor had</i> not removed to Babylon. 
8| And there came to Godolias to  Massepha Ismael the son of Nathanias, and Joanan son of Caree, and Saraeas the  son of Thanaemeth, and the sons of Jophe the Netophathite, and Ezonias son of  the Mochathite, they and their men.  
9| And Godolias swore to them and to  their men, saying, Be not afraid before the children of the Chaldeans: dwell in  the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be better for you.  
10|  And, behold, I dwell in your presence  at Massepha, to stand before the Chaldeans who shall come against you: and do ye  gather grapes, and fruits, and oil, and put <i>them</i> into your vessels, and  dwell in the cities which ye have obtained possession of.  
11| And all the Jews that were in Moab,  and among the children of Ammon, and those <i>that were</i> in Idumea, and those <i>that were</i> in all <i>the rest of</i> the country, heard that the king of  Babylon <i>had</i> granted a remnant to Juda, and that he had appointed over  them Godolias the son of Achicam. 
12|  And they came to Godolias into the land of Juda, to Massepha, and  gathered grapes, and very much summer fruit, and oil.  
13| And Joanan the son of Caree, and all  the leaders of the host, who were in the fields, came to Godolias to Massepha, 
14| and said to him, Dost thou indeed  know that king Beleissa son of Ammon has sent Ismael to thee to slay thee? But  Godolias believed them not. 
15| And  Joanan said to Godolias secretly in Massepha, I will go now and smite Ismael,  and let no man know <i>it</i>; lest he slay thee, and all the Jews that are  gathered to thee be dispersed, and the remnant of Juda perish.  
16| But Godolias said to Joanan, Do not the  thing, for thou speakest lies concerning Ismael.  Chapter  48  

#48
1| Now it came to pass in the seventh  month that Ismael the son of Nathanias the son of Eleasa of the seed royal,  came, and ten men with him, to Godolias to Massepha: and they ate bread there  together. 
2| And Ismael rose up, and  the ten men that were with him, and smote Godolias, whom the king of Babylon had  appointed <i>governor</i> over the land, 
3|  and all the Jews that were with him in Massepha, and all the  Chaldeans that were found there.  
4| And it came to pass on the second day  after he had smitten Godolias, and no man knew <i>of it</i>,  
5| that there came men from Sychem, and from  Salem, and from Samaria, <i>even</i> eighty men, having their beards shaven, and  their clothes rent, and beating their breasts, and <i>they had</i> manna and  frankincense in their hands, to bring <i>them</i> into the house of the Lord. 
6| And Ismael went out to meet them; <i>and</i> they went on and wept: and he said to them, Come in to Godolias. 
7| And it came to pass, when they had  entered into the midst of the city, <i>that</i> he slew them <i>and cast them</i>  into a pit. 
8| But ten men were found  there, and they said to Ismael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field,  wheat and barley, honey and oil. So he passed by, and slew them not in the midst  of their brethren.  
9| Now the pit into which Ismael cast all  whom he smote, is the great pit, which king Asa had made for fear of Baasa king  of Israel: <i>even</i> this Ismael filled with slain men.  
10| And Ismael brought back all the  people that were left in Massepha, and the king’s daughter, whom the captain of  the guard had committed in charge to Godolias the son of Achicam: and he went  away beyond the children of Ammon.
11| And Joanan the son of Caree, and all  the leaders of the host that were with him, heard of all the evil deeds which  Ismael had done. 
12| And they brought  all their army, and went to fight against him, and found him near much water in  Gabaon. 
13| And it came to pass, when  all the people that was with Ismael saw Joanan, and the leaders of the host that  was with him, 
14|  that they returned  to Joanan. 
15| But Ismael escaped  with eight men and went to the children of Ammon.  
16| And Joanan, and all the leaders of  the host that were with him, took all the remnant of the people, whom he <i>had</i>  brought back from Ismael, mighty men in war, and the women, and the other <i> property</i>, and the eunuchs, whom they <i>had</i> brought back from Gabaon: 
17| and they departed, and dwelt in  Gaberoch-amaa, that is by Bethleem, to go into Egypt, for fear of the Chaldeans: 
18| for they were afraid of them,  because Ismael had smitten Godolias, whom the king of Babylon made <i>governor</i>  in the land.  Chapter  49 

#49
1| Then came all the leaders of the  host, and Joanan, and Azarias the son of Maasaeas, and all the people great and  small, 
2| to Jeremias the prophet,  and said to him, Let now our supplication come before thy face, and pray thou to  the Lord thy God for this remnant; for we are left few out of many, as thine  eyes see. 
3| And let the Lord thy God  declare to us the way wherein we should walk, and the thing which we should do.  
4| And Jeremias said to them, I have  heard <i>you</i>; behold, I will pray for you to the Lord our God, according to  your words; and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> whatsoever word the Lord God  shall answer, I will declare <i>it</i> to you; I will not hide anything from  you.  
5| And they said to Jeremias, Let the  Lord be between us for a just and faithful witness, if we do not according to  every word which the Lord shall send to us. 
6|  And whether <i>it be</i> good, or whether <i>it be</i> evil, we  will hearken to the voice of the Lord our God, to whom we send thee; that it may  be well with us, because we shall hearken to the voice of the Lord our God.
7| And it came to pass after ten days, <i> that</i> the word of the Lord came to Jeremias. 
8|  And he called Joanan, and the leaders of the host, and all the  people from the least even to the greatest, 
9|  and he said to them, Thus saith the Lord; 
 10| If ye will indeed dwell in this land, I will build you,  and will not pull <i>you</i> down, but will plant you, and in no wise pluck you  up: for I have ceased from the calamities which I brought upon you.  
11| Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of  whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the Lord: for I am with you, to  deliver you, and save you out of their hand. 
12|  And I will grant you mercy, and pity you, and will restore you to  your land.  
13| But if ye say, We will not dwell in  this land, that we may not hearken to the voice of the Lord;  
14| for we will go into the land of Egypt,  and we shall see no war, and shall not hear the sound of a trumpet, and we shall  not hunger for bread; and there we will dwell: 
15|  then hear the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord;  
16| If ye set your face toward Egypt, and go  in there to dwell; then it shall be, <i>that</i> the sword which ye fear shall  find you in the land of Egypt, and the famine to which ye have regard, shall  overtake you, <i>coming</i> after you in Egypt; and there ye shall die.  
17| And all the men, and all the strangers  who have set their face toward the land of Egypt to dwell there, shall be  consumed by the sword, and by the famine: and there shall not one of them escape  from the evils which I bring upon them.  
18| For thus saith the Lord; As my wrath  has dropped upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my wrath drop upon you,  when ye have entered into Egypt: and ye shall be a desolation, and under the  power of others, and a curse and a reproach: and ye shall no more see this  place.  
19| <i>These are the words</i> which the  Lord has spoken concerning you the remnant of Juda; Enter ye not into Egypt: and  now know ye for a certainty, 
20| that  ye have wrought wickedness in your hearts, when ye sent me, saying, Pray thou  for us to the Lord; and according to all that the Lord shall speak to thee we  will do. 
21| And ye have not  hearkened to the voice of the Lord, with which he sent me to you.  
22| Now therefore ye shall perish by sword  and by famine, in the place which ye desire to go into to dwell there. Chapter  50  

#50
1| And it came to pass, when Jeremias  ceased speaking to the people all the words of the Lord, <i>for</i> which the  Lord had sent him to them, <i>even</i> all these words, 
2| that Azarias son of Maasaeas spoke, and Joanan, the son of  Caree, and all the men who had spoken to Jeremias, saying, <i>It is</i> false:  the Lord has not sent thee to us, saying, Enter not into Egypt to dwell there: 
3| but Baruch the son of Nerias sets  thee against us, that thou mayest deliver us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to  kill us, and that we should be carried away captives to Babylon.  
4| So Joanan, and all the leaders of the  host, and all the people, refused to hearken to the voice of the Lord, to dwell  in the land of Juda.  
5| And Joanan, and all the leaders of the  host, took all the remnant of Juda, who had returned to dwell in the land; 
6| the mighty men, and the women, and  the children that were left, and the daughters of the king, and the souls which  Nabuzardan had left with Godolias the son of Achicam and Jeremias the prophet,  and Baruch the son of Nerias. 
7| And  they came into Egypt: for they hearkened not to the voice of the Lord: and they  entered into Taphnas.
8| And the word of the Lord came to  Jeremias in Taphnas, saying, 
9| Take  thee great stones, and hide them in the entrance, at the gate of the house of  Pharao in Taphnas, in the sight of the men of Juda: 
10| and thou shalt say, Thus has the Lord said; Behold, I <i> will</i> send, and will bring Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon, and he shall place  his throne upon these stones which thou hast hidden, and he shall lift up  weapons against them. 
11| And he  shall enter in, and smite the land of Egypt, <i>delivering</i> some for death to  death; and some for captivity to captivity; and some for the sword to the sword. 
12| And he shall kindle a fire in the  houses of their gods, and shall burn them, and shall carry them away captives:  and shall search the land of Egypt, as a shepherd searches his garment; and he  shall go forth in peace. 
13| And he  shall break to pieces the pillars of Heliopolis that are in On, and shall burn  their houses with fire.  Chapter  51  

#51
1| THE WORD THAT CAME TO JEREMIAS for  all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt, and for those settled in Magdolo and  in Taphnas, and in the land of Pathura, saying,  
2| Thus has the Lord God of Israel said;  Ye have seen all the evils which I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon the  cities of Juda; and, behold, they are desolate without inhabitants,  
3|  because of their wickedness, which they  have wrought to provoke me, <i>by</i> going to burn incense to other gods, whom  ye knew not. 
4| yet I sent to you my  servants the prophets early in the morning, and I sent, saying, Do not ye this  abominable thing which I hate.  
5| But they hearkened not to me, and  inclined not their ear to turn from their wickedness, so as not to burn incense  to strange gods. 
6| So mine anger and  my wrath dropped <i>upon them</i>, and was kindled in the gates of Juda, and in  the streets of Jerusalem; and they became a desolation and a waste, as at this  day.  
7| And now thus has the Lord Almighty  said, Wherefore do ye commit <i>these</i> great evils against your souls? to cut  off man and woman of you, infant and suckling from the midst of Juda, to the end  that not one of you should be left; 
8|  by provoking me with the works of your hands, to burn incense to  other gods in the land of Egypt, into which ye entered to dwell there, that ye  might be cut off, and that ye might become a curse and a reproach among all the  nations of the earth? 
9| Have ye  forgotten the sins of your fathers, and the sins of the kings of Juda, and the  sins of your princes, and the sins of your wives, which they wrought in the land  of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
10|  And have not ceased even to this day, and they have not kept to  my ordinances, which I set before their fathers.  
11| Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold  I do set my face against <i>you</i> 
12|  to destroy all the remnant that are in Egypt; and they shall fall  by the sword, and by famine, and shall be consumed small and great: and they  shall be for reproach, and for destruction, and for a curse.  
13| And I will visit them that dwell in the  land of Egypt, as I have visited Jerusalem, with sword and with famine:  
14| and there shall not one be preserved of  the remnant of Juda that sojourn in the land of Egypt, to return to the land of  Juda, to which they hope in their hearts to return: they shall not return, but  only they that escape.
15| Then all the men that knew that their  wives burned incense, and all the women, a great multitude, and all the people  that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathura, answered Jeremias, saying,   
16| <i>As for</i> the word which thou  hast spoken to us in the name of the Lord, we will not hearken to thee.  
17| For we will surely perform every word  that shall proceed out of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and  to pour drink-offerings to her, as we and our fathers have done, and our kings  and princes, in the cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem: and <i>so</i>  we were filled with bread, and were well, and saw no evils.  
18| But since we left off to burn incense to  the queen of heaven, we have all been brought low, and have been consumed by  sword and by famine. 
19| And whereas  we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured drink-offerings to her, did  we make cakes to her, and pour drink-offerings to her, without our husbands?
20| Then Jeremias answered all the  people, the mighty men, and the women, and all the people that returned him <i> these</i> words for answer, saying, 
21|  Did not the Lord remember the incense which ye burned in the  cities of Juda, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye, and your fathers, and your  kings, and your princes, and the people of the land? and came it not into his  heart? 
22| And the Lord could no  longer bear <i>you</i>, because of the wickedness of your doings, and because of  your abominations which ye wrought; and so your land became a desolation and a  waste, and a curse, as at this day; 
23|  because of your burning incense, and <i>because</i> of the things  wherein ye sinned against the Lord: and ye have not hearkened to the voice of  the Lord, and have not walked in his ordinances, and in his law, and in his  testimonies; and so these evils have come upon you.  
24| And Jeremias said to the people, and  to the women, Hear ye the word of the Lord. 
25|   Thus has the Lord God of Israel said; Ye women have spoken with your mouth, and  ye fulfilled <i>it</i> with your hands, saying, We will surely perform our vows  that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour  drink-offerings to her: full well did ye keep to your vows, and ye have indeed  performed <i>them</i>. 
26| Therefore  hear ye the word of the Lord, all Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt; Behold, I  have sworn by my great name, saith the Lord, my name shall no longer be in the  mouth of every Jew to say, The Lord lives, in all the land of Egypt.  
27| For I have watched over them, to hurt  them, and not to do them good: and all the Jews dwelling in the land of Egypt  shall perish by sword and by famine, until they are utterly consumed.  
28| And they that escape the sword shall  return to the land of Juda few in number, and the remnant of Juda, who have  continued in the land <i>of</i> Egypt to dwell there, shall know whose word  shall stand.  
29| And this <i>shall be</i> a sign to  you, that I will visit you for evil. 
30|  Thus said the Lord; Behold, I <i>will</i> give Uaphres king of  Egypt into the hands of his enemy, and into the hands of one that seeks his  life; as I gave Sedekias king of Juda into the hands of Nabuchodonosor king of  Babylon, his enemy, and who sought his life.  Chapter  52

1| THE WORD WHICH JEREMIAS THE PROPHET  spoke to Baruch son of Nerias, when he wrote these words in the book from the  mouth of Jeremias, in the fourth year of Joakim the son of Josias king of Juda.  
2| Thus has the Lord said to thee, O  Baruch. 
3| Whereas thou hast said,  Alas! alas! for the Lord has laid a grievous trouble upon me; I lay down in  groaning, I found no rest; 
4| say  thou to him, Thus saith the Lord; Behold, I pull down those whom I have built  up, and I pluck up those whom I have planted. 
5|  And wilt thou seek great things for thyself? seek <i>them</i>  not: for, behold, I bring evil upon all flesh, saith the Lord: but I will give <i>to thee</i> thy life for a spoil in every place whither thou shalt go. It was the twenty-first year of Sedekias, when he began to  reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother’s name was  Amitaal, the daughter of Jeremias, of Lobena.  
4| And it came to pass in the ninth year  of his reign, in the ninth month, on the tenth day of the month, <i>that</i>  Nabuchodonosor king of Babylon came, and all his host, against Jerusalem, and  they made a rampart round it, and built a wall round about it with large stones.  
5| So the city was besieged, until the  eleventh year of king Sedekias, 
6| on  the ninth day of the month, and <i>then</i> the famine was severe in the city,  and there was no bread for the people of the land. 
7| And the city was broken up, and all the men of war went  out by night by the way of the gate, between the wall and the outworks, which  were by the king’s garden; and the Chaldeans were by the city round about; and  they went by the way <i>leading</i> to the wilderness. 
8| But the host of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and  overtook him in the <i>country</i> beyond Jericho; and all his servants were  dispersed from <i>about</i> him. 
9|  And they took the king, and brought him to the king of Babylon to Deblatha, and  he judged him. 
10| And the king of  Babylon slew the sons of Sedekias before his eyes; and he slew all the princes  of Juda in Deblatha. 
11| And he put  out the eyes of Sedekias, and bound him in fetters; and the king of Babylon  brought him to Babylon, and put him into the grinding-house, until the day when  he died.
12| And in the fifth month, on the tenth  day of the month, Nabuzardan the captain of the guard, who waited on the king of  Babylon, came to Jerusalem; 
13| and  he burnt the house of the Lord, and the king’s house; and all the houses of the  city, and every great house he burnt with fire. 
14|  And the host of the Chaldeans that was with the captain of the  guard pulled down all the wall of Jerusalem round about. 
 15 16| But the captain of the guard left the remnant of the  people to be vinedressers and husbandmen.  
17| And the Chaldeans broke in pieces the  brazen pillars that were in the house of the Lord, and the bases, and the brazen  sea that was in the house of the Lord, and they took the brass thereof, and  carried it away to Babylon. 
18| Also  the rim, and the bowls, and the flesh-hooks, and all the brazen vessels,  wherewith they ministered; 
19| and  the basons, and the snuffers, and the oil-funnels, and the candlesticks, and the  censers, and the cups, the golden, of gold, and the silver, of silver, the  captain of the guard took away. 
20|  And the two pillars, and the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen under the sea,  which <i>things</i> king Solomon made for the house of the Lord; the brass of  which <i>articles</i> was without weight.  
21| And as for the pillars, the height of  one pillar was thirty-five cubits; and a line of twelve cubits compassed it  round; and the thickness of it <i>all</i> round was four fingers.  
22| And <i>there was</i> a brazen chapiter  upon them, and the length was five cubits, <i>even</i> the height of one  chapiter; and <i>there were</i> on the chapiter round about network and  pomegranates, all of brass: and correspondingly the second pillar <i>had</i>  eight pomegranates to a cubit for the twelve cubits. 
23| And the pomegranates were ninety-six on a side; and all  the pomegranates on the network round about were a hundred.
24| And the captain of the guard took the  chief priest, and the second priest, and those that kept the way;  
25| and one eunuch, who was over the men of  war, and seven men of renown, who were in the king’s presence that were found in  the city; and the scribe of the forces, who did the part of a scribe to the  people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, who were found in  the midst of the city. 
26| And  Nabuzardan the captain of the king’s guard took them, and brought them to the  king of Babylon to Deblatha. 
27| And  the king of Babylon smote them in Deblatha, in the land of Æmath.  
28 29 30 31| And it came to pass in the  thirty-seventh year after that Joakim king of Juda had been carried away  captive, in the twelfth month, on the four and twentieth <i>day</i> of the  month, <i>that</i> Ulaemadachar king of Babylon, in the year in which he began  to reign, raised the head of Joakim king of Juda, and shaved him, and brought  him out of the house where he was kept, 
32|  and spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the kings that  were with him in Babylon, 
33| and  changed his prison garments: and he ate bread continually before him all the  days that he lived. 

34| And his  appointed portion was given him continually by the king of Babylon from day to  day, until the day when he died.   Presented by The Common Man&#39;s Prospective. Copyright© 1999-2010 Ernest C. Marsh
