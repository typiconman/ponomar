1| The vision which Esaias the son of Amos saw, which he saw against Juda, and against Jerusalem, in the reign of Ozias, and Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias, who reigned over Judea.
2| Hear, O heaven, and hearken, O earth: for the Lord has spoken, <i>saying</i>, I have begotten and reared up children, but they have rebelled against me. 
3| The ox knows his owner, and the ass his master’s crib: but Israel does not know me, and the people has not regarded me. 
4| Ah sinful nation, a people full of sins, an evil seed, lawless children: ye have forsaken the Lord, and provoked the Holy One of Israel. 
5| Why should ye be smitten <i>any</i> more, transgressing more and more? the whole head is pained, and the whole heart sad. 
6| From the feet to the head, there is no soundness in them; neither wound, nor bruise, nor festering ulcer <i>are healed</i>: it is not possible to apply a plaister, nor oil, nor bandages. 
7| Your land is desolate, your cities burned with fire: your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is made desolate, overthrown by strange nations. 
8| The daughter of Sion shall be deserted as a tent in a vineyard, and as a storehouse of fruits in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city. 
9| And if the Lord of Sabaoth had not left us a seed, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been made like Gomorrha.
10| Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodoma; attend to the law of God, thou people of Gomorrha. 
11| Of what <i>value</i> to me is the abundance of your sacrifices? saith the Lord: I am full of whole-burnt-offerings of rams; and I delight not in the fat of lambs, and the blood of bulls and goats: 
12| neither shall ye come <i>with these</i> to appear before me; for who has required these things at your hands? Ye shall no more tread my court. 
13| Though ye bring fine flour, <i>it is</i> vain; incense is an abomination to me; I cannot bear your new moons, and your sabbaths, and the great day; 
14| <i>your</i> fasting, and rest from work, your new moons also, and your feasts my soul hates: ye have become loathsome to me; I will no more pardon your sins. 
15| When ye stretch forth your hands, I will turn away mine eyes from you: and though ye make many supplications, I will not hearken to you; for your hands are full of blood.
16| Wash you, be clean; remove your iniquities from your souls before mine eyes; cease from your iniquities; 
17| learn to do well; diligently seek judgment, deliver him that is suffering wrong, plead for the orphan, and obtain justice for the widow. 
18| And come, let us reason together, saith the Lord: and though your sins be as purple, I will make them white as snow; and though they be as scarlet, I will make <i>them</i> white as wool. 
19| And if ye be willing, and hearken to me, ye shall eat the good of the land: 
20| but if ye be not willing, nor hearken to me, a sword shall devour you: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this.
21| How has the faithful city Sion, <i>once</i> full of judgment, become a harlot! wherein righteousness lodged, but now murderers. 
22| Your silver is worthless, thy wine merchants mix the wine with water. 
23| Thy princes are rebellious, companions of thieves, loving bribes, seeking after rewards; not pleading for orphans, and not heeding the cause of widows. 
24| Therefore thus saith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, Woe to the mighty <i>men</i> of Israel; for my wrath shall not cease against mine adversaries, and I will execute judgment on mine enemies. 
25| And I will bring my hand upon thee, and purge thee completely, and I will destroy the rebellious, and will take away from thee all transgressors. 
26| And I will establish thy judges as before, and thy counsellors as at the beginning: and afterward thou shalt be called the city of righteousness, the faithful mother-city of Sion. 
27| For her captives shall be saved with judgment, and with mercy. 
28| And the transgressors and the sinners shall be crushed together, and they that forsake the Lord shall be utterly consumed. 
29| For they shall be ashamed of their idols, which they delighted in, and they are made ashamed of the gardens which they coveted. 
30| For they shall be as a turpentine tree that has cast its leaves, and as a garden that has no water. 
31| And their strength shall be as a thread of tow, and their works as sparks, and the transgressors and the sinners shall be burnt up together, and there shall be none to quench <i>them</i>.

1| The word which came to Esaias the son of Amos concerning Judea, and concerning Jerusalem. 
2| For in the last days the mountain of the Lord shall be glorious, and the house of God <i>shall be</i> on the top of the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and all nations shall come to it. 
3| And many nations shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob; and he will tell us his way, and we will walk in it: for out of Sion shall go forth the law, and the word of the Lord out of Jerusalem. 
4| And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their swords into plow-shares, and their spears into sickles: and nation shall not take up sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more. 
5| And now, O house of Jacob, come, <i>and</i> let us walk in the light of the Lord. 
6| For he has forsaken his people the house of Israel, because their land is filled as at the beginning with divinations, as the <i>land</i> of the Philistines, and many strange children were born to them. 
7| For their land is filled with silver and gold, and there was no number of their treasures; their land also is filled with horses, and there was no number of chariots. 
8| And the land is filled with abominations, <i>even</i> the works of their hands; and they have worshipped <i>the works</i> which their fingers made. 
9| And the mean man bowed down, and the great man was humbled: and I will not pardon them.
10| Now therefore enter ye into the rocks, and hide yourselves in the earth, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth. 
11| For the eyes of the Lord are high, but man is low; and the haughtiness of men shall be brought low, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. 
12| For the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and haughty, and upon every one that is high and towering, and they shall be brought down; 
13| and upon every cedar of Libanus, of them that are high and towering, and upon every oak of Basan, 
14| and upon every high mountain, and upon every high hill, 
15| and upon every high tower, and upon every high wall, 
16| and upon every ship of the sea, and upon every display of fine ships. 
17| And every man shall be brought low, and the pride of men shall fall: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. 
18| And they shall hide all <i>idols</i> made with hands, 
19| having carried <i>them</i> into the caves, and into the clefts of the rocks, and into the caverns of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth. 
20| For in that day a man shall cast forth his silver and gold abominations, which they made <i>in order</i> to worship vanities and bats; 
21| to enter into the caverns of the solid rock, and into the clefts of the rocks, for fear of the Lord, and by reason of the glory of his might, when he shall arise to strike terribly the earth.

1| Behold now, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will take away from Jerusalem and from Judea the mighty man and mighty woman, the strength of bread, and the strength of water, 
2| the great and mighty man, the warrior and the judge, and the prophet, and the counsellor, and the elder, 
3| the captain of fifty also, and the honourable counsellor, and the wise artificer, and the intelligent hearer. 
4| And I will make youths their princes, and mockers shall have dominion over them. 
5| And the people shall fall, man upon man, and <i>every</i> man upon his neighbor: the child shall insult the elder man, and the base the honourable. 
6| For a man shall lay hold of his brother, as one of his father’s household, saying, Thou hast raiment, be thou our ruler, and let my meat be under thee. 
7| And he shall answer in that day, and say, I will not be thy ruler; for I have no bread in my house, nor raiment: I will not be the ruler of this people. 
8| For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judea has fallen, and their tongues <i>have spoken</i> with iniquity, disobedient <i>as they are</i> towards the Lord. 
9| Wherefore now their glory has been brought low, and the shame of their countenance has withstood them, and they have proclaimed their sin as Sodom, and made it manifest. 
10| Woe to their soul, for they have devised an evil counsel against themselves, saying against themselves, Let us bind the just, for he is burdensome to us: therefore shall they eat the fruits of their works. 
11| Woe to the transgressor! evils shall happen to him according to the works of his hands. 
12| O my people, your exactors strip you, and extortioners rule over you: O my people, they that pronounce you blessed lead you astray, and pervert the path of your feet. 
13| But now the Lord will stand up for judgment, and will enter into judgment with his people. 
14| The Lord himself shall enter into judgment with the elders of the people, and with their rulers: but why have ye set my vineyard on fire, and <i>why is</i> the spoil of the poor in your houses? 
15| Why do ye wrong my people, and shame the face of the poor?
16| Thus saith the Lord, Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with an outstretched neck, and with winking of the eyes, and motion of the feet, at the same time drawing their garments in trains, and at the same time sporting with their feet: 
17| therefore the Lord will humble the chief daughters of Sion, and the Lord will expose their form in that day; 
18| and the Lord will take away the glory of their raiment, the curls and the fringes, and the crescents, 
19| and the chains, and the ornaments of their faces, 
20| and the array of glorious ornaments, and the armlets, and the bracelets, and the wreathed work, and the finger-rings, and the ornaments for the right hand, 
21 22 23| and the ear-rings, and the garments with scarlet borders, and the garments with purple grounds, and the shawls to be worn in the house, and the Spartan transparent dresses, and those made of fine linen, and the purple <i>ones</i>, and the scarlet <i>ones</i>, and the fine linen, interwoven with gold and purple, and the light coverings for couches. 
24| And there shall be instead of a sweet smell, dust; and instead of a girdle, thou shalt gird thyself with a rope; and instead of a golden ornament for the head, thou shalt have baldness on account of thy works; and instead of a tunic with a scarlet ground, thou shalt gird thyself with sackcloth. 
25| And thy most beautiful son whom thou lovest shall fall by the sword; and your mighty men shall fall by the sword, and shall be brought low. 
26| And the stores of your ornaments shall mourn, and thou shalt be left alone, and shalt be levelled with the ground. 

#4
1| And seven women shall take hold of one man, saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own raiment: only let thy name be called upon us, <i>and</i>&nbsp; take away our reproach.
2| And in that day God shall shine gloriously in counsel on the earth, to exalt and glorify the remnant of Israel. 
3| And it shall be, <i>that</i> the remnant left in Sion, and the remnant left in Jerusalem, <i>even</i> all that are appointed to life in Jerusalem, shall be called holy. 
4| For the Lord shall wash away the filth of the sons and daughters of Sion, and shall purge out the blood from the midst of them, with the spirit of judgment, and the spirit of burning. 
5| And he shall come, and it shall be with regard to every place of mount Sion, yea, all the region round about it shall a cloud overshadow by day, and <i>there shall be</i> as it were the smoke and light of fire burning by night: and upon all the glory shall be a defence. 
6| And it shall be for a shadow from the heat, and as a shelter and a hiding place from inclemency <i>of weather</i> and from rain.

1| Now I will sing to <i>my</i> beloved a song of my beloved concerning my vineyard. <i>My</i> beloved had a vineyard on a high hill in a fertile place. 
2| And I made a hedge round it, and dug a trench, and planted a choice vine, and built a tower in the midst of it, and dug a place for the wine-vat in it: and I waited <i>for it</i> to bring forth grapes, and it brought forth thorns. 
3| And now, ye dwellers in Jerusalem, and <i>every</i> man of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard. 
4| What shall I do any more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? Whereas I expected <i>it</i> to bring forth grapes, but it has brought forth thorns. 
5| And now I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be for a spoil; and I will pull down its walls, and it shall be <i>left</i> to be trodden down. 
6| And I will forsake my vineyard; and it shall not be pruned, nor dug, and thorns shall come up upon it as on barren land; and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it. 
7| For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel, and the men of Juda <i>his</i> beloved plant: I expected <i>it</i> to bring forth judgment, and it brought forth iniquity; and not righteousness, but a cry.
8| Woe <i>to them</i> that join house to house, and add field to field, that they may take away something of their neighbor’s: will ye dwell alone upon the land? 
9| For these things have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts: for though many houses should be built, many and fair houses shall be desolate, and there shall be no inhabitants in them. 
10| For where ten yoke of oxen plough <i>the land</i> shall yield one jar-full, and he that sows six homers shall produce three measures. 
11| Woe <i>to them</i> that rise up in the morning, and follow strong drink; who wait <i>at it till</i> evening: for the wine shall inflame them. 
12| For they drink wine with harp, and psaltery, and drums, and pipes: but they regard not the works of the Lord, and consider not the works of his hands. 
13| Therefore my people have been taken captive, because they know not the Lord: and there has been a multitude of dead <i>bodies</i>, because of hunger and of thirst for water. 
14| Therefore hell has enlarged its desire and opened its mouth without ceasing: and her glorious and great, and her rich and her pestilent men shall go down <i>into it</i>. 
15| And the mean man shall be brought low, and the great man shall be disgraced, and the lofty eyes shall be brought low. 
16| But the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be glorified in righteousness. 
17| And they that were spoiled shall be fed as bulls, and lambs shall feed on the waste places of them that are taken away.
18| Woe <i>to them</i> that draw sins to them as with a long rope, and iniquities as with a thong of the heifer’s yoke: 
19| who say, Let him speedily hasten what he will do, that we may see <i>it</i>: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know <i>it</i>. 
20| Woe <i>to them</i> that call evil good, and good evil; who make darkness light, and light darkness; who make bitter sweet, and sweet bitter. 
21| Woe <i>to them</i> that are wise in their own conceit, and knowing in their own sight. 
22| Woe to the strong <i>ones</i> of you that drink wine, and the mighty <i>ones</i> that mingle strong drink: 
23| who justify the ungodly for rewards, and take away the righteousness of the righteous. 
24| Therefore as stubble shall be burnt by a coal of fire, and shall be consumed by a violent flame, their root shall be as chaff, and their flower shall go up as dust: for they rejected the law of the Lord of hosts, and insulted the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
25| Therefore the Lord of hosts was greatly angered against his people, and he reached forth his hand upon them, and smote them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses were as dung in the midst of the way: yet for all this his anger has not been turned away, but his hand is yet raised. 
26| Therefore shall he lift up a signal to the nations that are afar, and shall hiss for them from the end of the earth; and, behold, they are coming very quickly. 
27| They shall not hunger nor be weary, neither shall they slumber nor sleep; neither shall they loose their girdles from their loins, neither shall their shoe-latchets be broken. 
28| Whose arrows are sharp, and their bows bent; their horses’ hoofs are counted as solid rock: their chariot-wheels are as a storm. 
29| They rage as lions, and draw nigh as a lion’s whelps: and he shall seize, and roar as a wild beast, and he shall cast <i>them</i> forth, and there shall be none to deliver them. 
30| And he shall roar on account of them in that day, as the sound of the swelling sea; and they shall look to the land, and, behold, <i>there shall be</i> thick darkness in their perplexity.

1| And it came to pass in the year in which king Ozias died, <i>that</i> I saw the Lord sitting on a high and exalted throne, and the house was full of his glory. 
2| And seraphs stood round about him: each one had six wings: and with two they covered <i>their</i> face, and with two they covered <i>their</i> feet, and with two they flew. 
3| And one cried to the other, and they said, Holy, holy, holy <i>is the</i> Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory. 
4| And the lintel shook at the voice they uttered, and the house was filled with smoke. 
5| And I said, Woe is me, for I am pricked to the heart; for being a man, and having unclean lips, I dwell in the midst of a people having unclean lips; and I have seen with mine eyes the King, the Lord of hosts. 
6| And there was sent to me one of the seraphs, and he had in his hand a coal, which he had taken off the altar with the tongs: 
7| and he touched my mouth, and said, Behold, this has touched thy lips, and will take away thine iniquities, and will purge off thy sins. 
8| And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send, and who will go to this people? And I said, behold, I am <i>here</i>, send me. And he said, Go, and say to this people, 
9| Ye shall hear indeed, but ye shall not understand; and ye shall see indeed, but ye shall not perceive. 
10| For the heart of this people has become gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should heal them. 
11| And I said, How long, O Lord? And he said, Until cities be deserted by reason of their not being inhabited, and the houses by reason of there being no men, and the land shall be left desolate. 
12| And after this God shall remove the men far off, and they that are left upon the land shall be multiplied. 
13| And yet there shall be a tenth upon it, and again it shall be for a spoil, as a turpentine tree, and as an acorn when it falls out of its husk.

1| And it came to pass in the days of Achaz <i>the son</i> of Joatham, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, there came up Rasim king of Aram, and Phakee son of Romelias, king of Israel, against Jerusalem to war against it, but they could not take it. 
2| And a message was brought to the house of David, saying, Aram has conspired with Ephraim. And his soul was amazed, and the soul of his people, as in a wood a tree is moved by the wind. 
3| And the Lord said to Esaias, Go forth to meet Achaz, thou, and thy son Jasub who is left, to the pool of the upper way of the fuller’s field. 
4| And thou shalt say to him, Take care to be quiet, and fear not, neither let thy soul be disheartened because of these two smoking firebrands: for when my fierce anger is over, I will heal again. 
5| And <i>as for</i> the son of Aram, and the son of Romelias, forasmuch as they have devised an evil counsel, <i>saying</i>, 
6| We will go up against Judea, and having conferred with them we will turn them away to our side, and we will make the son of Tabeel king of it; 
7| thus saith the Lord of hosts, This counsel shall not abide, nor come to pass. 
8| But the head of Aram is Damascus, and the head of Damascus, Rasim; and yet within sixty and five years the kingdom of Ephraim shall cease from <i>being</i> a people. 
9| And the head of Ephraim is Somoron, and the head of Somoron the son of Romelias: but if ye believe not, neither will ye at all understand.
10| And the Lord again spoke to Achaz, saying, 
11| Ask for thyself a sign of the Lord thy God, in the depth or in the height. 
12| And Achaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the Lord. 
13| And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; is it a little thing for you to contend with men? and how do ye contend against the Lord? 
14| Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive in the womb, and shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Emmanuel. 
15| Butter and honey shall he eat, before he knows either to prefer evil <i>or</i> choose the good. 
16| For before the child shall know good or evil, he refuses evil, to choose the good; and the land shall be forsaken which thou art afraid of because of the two kings.
17| But God shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days which have never come, from the day that Ephraim took away from Juda the king of the Assyrians. 
18| And it shall come to pass in that day that the Lord shall hiss for the flies, which <i>insect</i> shall rule over a part of the river of Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of the Assyrians. 
19| And they all shall enter into the clefts of the land, and into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves, and into every ravine. 
20| In that day the Lord shall shave with the hired razor of the king of Assyria beyond the river the head, and the hairs of the feet, and will remove the beard. 
21| And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> a man shall rear a heifer, and two sheep. 
22| And it shall come to pass from their drinking an abundance of milk, <i>that</i> every one that is left on the land shall eat butter and honey. 
23| And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>for</i> every place where there shall be a thousand vines at a thousand shekels, they shall become barren land and thorns. 
24| <i>Men</i> shall enter thither with arrow and bow; for all the land shall be <i>barren</i> ground and thorns. 
25| And every mountain shall be certainly ploughed: there shall no fear come thither: for there shall be from <i>among</i> the <i>barren</i> ground and thorns that whereon cattle shall feed and oxen shall tread.

1| And the Lord said to me, Take to thyself a volume of a great new <i>book</i>, and write in it with a man’s pen concerning the making a rapid plunder of spoils; for it is near at hand. 
2| And make me witnesses <i>of</i> faithful men, Urias, and Zacharias the son of Barachias. 
3| And I went in to the prophetess; and she conceived, and bore a son. And the Lord said to me, Call his name, Spoil quickly, plunder speedily. 
4| For before the child shall know <i>how</i> to call <i>his</i> father or <i>his</i> mother, <i>one</i> shall take the power of Damascus and the spoils of Samaria before the king of the Assyrians. 
5| And the Lord spoke to me yet again, <i>saying</i>, 
6| Because this people chooses not the water of Siloam that goes softly, but wills to have Rassin, and the son of Romelias <i>to be</i> king over you; 
7| therefore, behold, the Lord brings up upon you the water of the river, strong and abundant, <i>even</i> the king of the Assyrians, and his glory: and he shall come up over every valley of yours, and shall walk over every wall of yours: 
8| and he shall take away from Juda <i>every</i> man who shall be able to lift up his head, <i>and every one</i> able to accomplish anything; and his camp shall fill the breadth of thy land, <i>O</i> God with us.
9| Know, ye Gentiles, and be conquered; hearken ye, even to the extremity of the earth: be conquered, after ye strengthened yourselves; for even if ye should again strengthen yourselves, ye shall again be conquered. 
10| And whatsoever counsel ye shall take, the Lord shall bring it to nought; and whatsoever word ye shall speak, it shall not stand among you: for God is with us. 
11| Thus saith the Lord, With a strong hand they revolt from the course of the way of this people, saying, 
12| Let them not say, <i>It is</i> hard, for whatsoever this people says, is hard: but fear not ye their fear, neither be dismayed. 
13| Sanctify ye the Lord himself; and he shall be thy fear. 
14| And if thou shalt trust in him, he shall be to thee for a sanctuary; and ye shall not come against <i>him</i> as against a stumbling-stone, neither as against the falling of a rock: but the houses of Jacob are in a snare, and the dwellers in Jerusalem in a pit. 
15| Therefore many among them shall be weak, and fall, and be crushed; and they shall draw nigh, and men shall be taken securely. 
16| Then shall those who seal themselves that they may not learn the law be made manifest. 
17| And <i>one</i> shall say, I will wait for God, who has turned away his face from the house of Jacob, and I will trust in him. 
18| Behold I and the children which God has given me: and they shall be <i>for</i> signs and wonders in the house of Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells in mount Sion. 
19| And if they should say to you, Seek those who have in them a divining spirit, and them that speak out of the earth, them that speak vain words, who speak out of their belly: shall not a nation diligently seek to their God? why do they seek to the dead concerning the living? 
20| For he has given the law for a help, that they should not speak according to this word, concerning which there are no gifts to give for it. 
21| And famine shall come sorely upon you, and it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> when ye shall be hungry, ye shall be grieved, and ye shall speak ill of the prince and your fathers’ ordinances: and they shall look up to heaven above, 
22| and they shall look on the earth below, and behold severe distress, and darkness, affliction, and anguish, and darkness so that <i>one cannot</i> see; and he that is in anguish shall not be distressed only for a time.

1| Drink this first. Act quickly, O land of Zabulon, land of Nephthalim, and the rest <i>inhabiting</i> the sea-coast, and <i>the land</i> beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles. 
2| O people walking in darkness, behold a great light: ye that dwell in the region <i>and</i> shadow of death, a light shall shine upon you. 
3| The multitude of the people which thou hast brought down in thy joy, they shall even rejoice before thee as they that rejoice in harvest, and as they that divide the spoil. 
4| Because the yoke that was laid upon them has been taken away, and the rod that was on their neck: for he has broken the rod of the exactors, as in the day of Madiam. 
5| For they shall compensate for every garment that has been acquired by deceit, and <i>all</i> raiment with restitution; and they shall be willing, <i>even</i> if they were burnt with fire. 
6| For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder: and his name is called the Messenger of great counsel: for I will bring peace upon the princes, and health to him. 
7| His government shall be great, and of his peace there is no end: <i>it shall be</i> upon the throne of David, and <i>upon</i> his kingdom, to establish it, and to support <i>it</i> with judgment and with righteousness, from henceforth and forever. The seal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this.
8| The Lord has sent death upon Jacob, and it has come upon Israel. 
9| And all the people of Ephraim, and they that dwelt in Samaria shall know, who say in their pride and lofty heart, 
10| The bricks are fallen down, but come, let us hew stones, and cut down sycamores and cedars, and let us build for ourselves a tower. 
11| And God shall dash down them that rise up against him on mount Sion, and shall scatter his enemies; 
12| <i>even</i> Syria from the rising of the sun, and the Greeks from the setting of the sun, who devour Israel with open mouth. For all this <i>his</i> anger is not turned away, but still <i>his</i> hand is exalted. 
13| But the people turned not until they were smitten, and they sought not the Lord. 
14| So the Lord took away from Israel the head and tail, great and small, in one day: 
15| the old man, and them that respect persons, this is the head; and the prophet teaching unlawful things, he is the tail. 
16| And they that pronounce this people blessed shall mislead them; and they mislead them that they may devour them. 
17| Therefore the Lord shall not take pleasure in their young men, neither shall he have pity on their orphans or on their widows: for they are all transgressors and wicked, and every mouth speaks unjustly. For all this <i>his</i> anger is not turned away, but <i>his</i> hand is yet exalted. 
18| And iniquity shall burn as fire, and shall be devoured by fire as dry grass: and it shall burn in the thickets of the wood, and shall devour all that is round about the hills. 
19| The whole earth is set on fire because of the fierce anger of the Lord, and the people shall be as men burnt by fire: no man shall pity his brother. 
20| But <i>one</i> shall turn aside to the right hand, for he shall be hungry; and shall eat on the left, and a man shall by no means be satisfied with eating the flesh of his own arm. 
21| For Manasses shall eat <i>the flesh</i> of Ephraim, and Ephraim <i>the flesh</i> of Manasses; for they shall besiege Juda together. For all this <i>his</i> anger is not turned away, but <i>his</i> hand is yet exalted.

1| Woe to them that write wickedness; for when they write they do write wickedness, 
2| perverting the cause of the poor, violently wresting the judgment of the needy ones of my people, that the widow may be a prey to them, and the orphan a spoil. 
3| And what will they do in the day of visitation? for affliction shall come to you from afar: and to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory, 
4| that ye may not fall into captivity? For all this <i>his</i> wrath is not turned away, but <i>his</i> hand is yet exalted.
5| Woe to the Assyrians; the rod of my wrath, and anger are in their hands. 
6| I will send my wrath against a sinful nation, and I will charge my people to take plunder and spoil, and to trample the cities, and to make them dust. 
7| But he meant not thus, neither did he devise thus in his soul: but his mind shall change, and <i>that</i> to destroy nations not a few. 
8| And if they should say to him, Thou alone art ruler; 
9| then shall he say, Have I not taken the country above Babylon and Chalanes, where the tower was built? and have I <i>not</i> taken Arabia, and Damascus, and Samaria? 
10| As I have taken them, I will also take all the kingdoms: howl, ye idols in Jerusalem, and in Samaria. 
11| For as I did to Samaria and her idols, so will I do also to Jerusalem and her idols. 
12| And it shall come to pass, when the Lord shall have finished doing all things on Mount Sion and Jerusalem, <i>that</i> I will visit upon the proud heart, <i>even</i> upon the ruler of the Assyrians, and upon the boastful haughtiness of his eyes. 
13| For he said, I will act in strength, and in the wisdom of <i>my</i> understanding I will remove the boundaries of nations, and will spoil their strength. 
14| And I will shake the inhabited cities: and I will take with my hand all the world as a nest: and I will even take them as eggs that have been left; and there is none that shall escape me, or contradict me. 
15| Shall the axe glorify itself without him that hews with it? or shall the saw lift up itself without him that uses it, as if one should lift a rod or staff? but it shall not be so; 
16| but the Lord of hosts shall send dishonour upon thine honour, and burning fire shall be kindled upon thy glory. 
17| And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and he shall sanctify him with burning fire, and it shall devour the wood as grass. 
18| In that day the mountains shall be consumed, and the hills, and the forests, and <i>fire</i> shall devour <i>both</i> soul and body: and he that flees shall be as one fleeing from burning flame. 
19| And they that are left of them shall be a <i>small</i> number, and a child shall write them.
20| And it shall come to pass in that day <i>that</i> the remnant of Israel shall no more join themselves with, and the saved of Jacob shall no more trust in, them that injured them; but they shall trust in the Holy God of Israel, in truth. 
21| And the remnant of Jacob shall <i>trust</i> on the mighty God. 
22| And though the people of Israel be as the sand of the sea, a remnant of them shall be saved. 
23| He will finish the work, and cut it short in righteousness: because the Lord will make a short work in all the world.
24| Therefore thus saith the Lord of hosts, Be not afraid, my people who dwell in Sion, of the Assyrians, because he shall smite thee with a rod: for I am bringing a stroke upon thee, that <i>thou</i> mayest see the way of Egypt. 
25| For yet a little while, and the indignation shall cease: but my wrath shall be against their council. 
26| And God will stir up <i>enemies</i> against them, according to the stroke of Madiam in the place of affliction: and his wrath shall be by the way of the sea, <i>even</i> to the way that leads to Egypt. 
27| And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> his yoke shall be taken away from thy shoulder, and his fear from thee, and the yoke shall be destroyed from off your shoulders. 
28| For he shall arrive at the city of Angai, and shall pass on to Maggedo, and shall lay up his stores in Machmas. 
29| And he shall pass by the valley, and shall arrive at Angai: fear shall seize upon Rama, the city of Saul. 
30| The daughter of Gallim shall flee; Laisa shall hear; one shall hear in Anathoth. 
31| Madebena also is amazed, and the inhabitants of Gibbir. 
32| Exhort ye <i>them</i> to-day to remain in the way: exhort ye <i>beckoning</i> with the hand the mountain, the daughter of Sion, even ye hills that are in Jerusalem. 
33| Behold, the Lord, the Lord of hosts, will mightily confound the glorious ones; and the haughty in pride shall be crushed, and the lofty shall be brought low: 
34| and the lofty ones shall fall by the sword, and the Libanus shall fall with his lofty ones. 

#11
1| And there shall come forth a rod out of the root of Jesse, and a blossom shall come up from <i>his</i> root: 
2| and the Spirit of God shall rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and strength, the spirit of knowledge and godliness shall fill him; 
3| the spirit of the fear of God. He shall not judge according to appearance, nor reprove according to report: 
4| but he shall judge the cause of the lowly, and shall reprove the lowly of the earth: and he shall smite the earth with the word of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips shall he destroy the ungodly one. 
5| And he shall have his loins girt with righteousness, and his sides clothed with truth. 
6| And the wolf shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall lie down with the kid; and the young calf and bull and lion shall feed together; and a little child shall lead them. 
7| And the ox and bear shall feed together; and their young shall be together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox. 
8| And an infant shall put his hand on the holes of asps, and on the nest of young asps. 
9| And they shall not hurt, nor shall they at all be able to destroy any one on my holy mountain: for the whole <i>world</i> is filled with the knowledge of the Lord, as much water covers the seas. 
10| And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, and he that shall arise to rule over the Gentiles; in him shall the Gentiles trust, and his rest shall be glorious. 
11| And it shall be in that day, <i>that</i> the Lord shall again shew his hand, to be zealous for the remnant that is left of the people, which shall be left by the Assyrians, and <i>that</i> from Egypt, and from the country of Babylon, and from Ethiopia, and from the Elamites, and from the rising of the sun, and out of Arabia. 
12| And he shall lift up a standard for the nations, and he shall gather the lost ones of Israel, and he shall gather the dispersed of Juda from the four corners of the earth. 
13| And the envy of Ephraim shall be taken away, and the enemies of Juda shall perish: Ephraim shall not envy Juda, and Juda shall not afflict Ephraim. 
14| And they shall fly in the ships of the Philistines: they shall at the same time spoil the sea, and them <i>that come</i> from the east, and Idumea: and they shall lay their hands on Moab first; but the children of Ammon shall first obey <i>them.</i> 
15| And the Lord shall make desolate the sea of Egypt; and he shall lay his hand on the river with a strong wind, and he shall smite the seven channels, so that men shall pass through it dry-shod. 
16| And there shall be a passage for my people that is left in Egypt: and it shall be to Israel as the day when he came forth out of the land of Egypt. 

#12
1| And in that day thou shalt say, I <i>will</i> bless thee, O Lord; for thou wast angry with me, but thou hast turned aside thy wrath, and hast pitied me. 
2| Behold, my God is my Saviour; I will trust in him, and not be afraid: for the Lord is my glory and my praise, and is become my salvation. 
3| Draw ye therefore water with joy out of the wells of salvation. 
4| And in that day thou shalt say, sing to the Lord, call aloud upon his name, proclaim his glorious <i>deeds</i> among the Gentiles; make mention that his name is exalted. 
5| Sing praise to the name of the Lord; for he has done great <i>things</i>: declare this in all the earth. 
6| Exalt and rejoice, ye that dwell in Sion: for the Holy One of Israel is exalted in the midst of her.

1| THE VISION WHICH ESAIAS SON OF AMOS SAW AGAINST BABYLON. 
2| Lift up a standard on the mountain of the plain, exalt the voice to them, beckon with the hand, open <i>the gates</i>, ye rulers. 
3| I give command, and I bring them: giants are coming to fulfil my wrath, rejoicing at the same time and insulting. 
4| A voice of many nations on the mountains, <i>even</i> like <i>to that</i> of many nations; a voice of kings and nations gathered together: the Lord of hosts has given command to a war-like nation, 
5| to come from a land afar off, from the utmost foundation of heaven; the Lord and his warriors <i>are coming</i> to destroy all the world.
6| Howl ye, for the day of the Lord is near, and destruction from God shall arrive. 
7| Therefore every hand shall become powerless, and every soul of man shall be dismayed. 
8| The elders shall be troubled, and pangs shall seize them, as of a woman in travail: and they shall mourn one to another, and shall be amazed, and shall change their countenance as a flame. 
9| For behold! the day of the Lord is coming which cannot be escaped, <i>a day</i> of wrath and anger, to make the world desolate, and to destroy sinners out of it. 
10| For the stars of heaven, and Orion, and all the host of heaven, shall not give their light; and it shall be dark at sunrise, and the moon shall not give her light. 
11| And I will command evils for the whole world, and <i>will visit</i> their sins on the ungodly: and I will destroy the pride of transgressors, and will bring low the pride of the haughty. 
12| And they that are left shall be more precious than gold tried in the fire; and a man shall be more precious than the stone that is in Suphir. 
13| For the heaven shall be enraged, and the earth shall be shaken from her foundation, because of the fierce anger of the Lord of hosts, in the day in which his wrath shall come on. 
14| And they that are left shall be as a fleeing fawn, and as a stray sheep, and there shall be none to gather <i>them</i>: so that a man shall turn back to his people, and a man shall flee to his own land. 
15| For whosoever shall be taken shall be overcome; and they that are gathered together shall fall by the sword. 
16| And they shall dash their children before their eyes; and they shall spoil their houses, and shall take their wives. 
17| Behold, I will stir up against you the Medes, who do not regard silver, neither have they need of gold. 
18| They shall break the bows of the young men; and they shall have no mercy on your children; nor shall their eyes spare thy children. 
19| And Babylon, which is called glorious by the king of the Chaldeans, shall be as <i>when</i> God overthrew Sodoma, and Gomorrha. 
20| It shall never be inhabited, neither shall any enter into it for many generations: neither shall the Arabians pass through it; nor shall shepherds at all rest in it. 
21| But wild beasts shall rest there; and the houses shall be filled with howling; and monsters shall rest there, and devils shall dance there, 
22| and satyrs shall dwell there; and hedgehogs shall make their nests in their houses. It will come soon, and will not tarry. 

#14
1| And the Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose Israel, and they shall rest on their land: and the stranger shall be added to them, yea, shall be added to the house of Jacob. 
2| And the Gentiles shall take them, and bring them into their place: and they shall inherit them, and they shall be multiplied upon the land for servants and handmaidens: and they that took them captives shall become captives <i>to them</i>; and they that had lordship over them shall be under <i>their</i> rule. 
3| And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the Lord shall give thee rest from thy sorrow and vexation, <i>and from</i> thy hard servitude wherein thou didst serve them. 
4| And thou shalt take up this lamentation against the king of Babylon, How has the extortioner ceased, and the taskmaster ceased! 
5| The Lord has broken the yoke of sinners, the yoke of princes. 
6| Having smitten a nation in wrath, with an incurable plague, smiting a nation with a wrathful plague, which spared <i>them</i> not, he rested in quiet. 
7| All the earth cries aloud with joy: 
8| the trees also of Libanus rejoice against thee, and the cedar of Libanus, <i>saying</i>, From the time that thou hast been laid low, no one has come up to cut us down. 
9| Hell from beneath is provoked to meet thee: all the great ones that have ruled over the earth have risen up together against thee, they that have raised up from their thrones all the kings of the nations. 
10| All shall answer and say to thee, Thou also hast been taken, even as we; and thou art numbered amongst us. 
11| Thy glory has come down to Hades, and thy great mirth: under thee they shall spread corruption, and the worm shall be thy covering. 
12| How has Lucifer, that rose in the morning, fallen from heaven! He that sent <i>orders</i> to all the nations is crushed to the earth. 
13| But thou saidst in thine heart, I will go up to heaven, I will set my throne above the stars of heaven: I will sit on a lofty mount, on the lofty mountains toward the north: 
14| I will go up above the clouds: I will be like the Most High. 
15| But now thou shalt go down to hell, even to the foundations of the earth. 
16| They that see thee shall wonder at thee, and say, This is the man that troubled the earth, that made kings to shake; 
17| that made the whole world desolate, and destroyed its cities; he loosed not those who were in captivity. 
18| All the kings of the nations lie in honour, <i>every</i> man in his house. 
19| But thou shalt be cast forth on the mountains, as a loathed carcase, with many dead who have been pierced with swords, going down to the grave. 
20| As a garment defiled with blood shall not be pure, so neither shalt thou be pure; because thou hast destroyed my land, and hast slain my people: thou shalt not endure for ever, —<i>thou</i> an evil seed. 
21| Prepare thy children to be slain for the sins of their father; that they arise not, and inherit the earth, nor fill the earth with wars. 
22| And I will rise up against them, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will destroy their name, and remnant, and seed: thus saith the Lord. 
23| And I will make the region of Babylon desert, so that hedgehogs shall dwell <i>there</i>, and it shall come to nothing: and I will make it a pit of clay for destruction.
24| Thus saith the Lord of hosts, As I have said, so it shall be: and as I have purposed, so <i>the matter</i> shall remain: 
25| <i>even</i> to destroy the Assyrians upon my land, and upon my mountains: and they shall be for trampling; and their yoke shall be taken away from them, and their glory shall be taken away from their shoulders. 
26| This is the purpose which the Lord has purposed upon the whole earth: and this the hand that is uplifted against all the nations. 
27| For what the Holy God has purposed, who shall frustrate? and who shall turn back his uplifted hand? 
28| In the year in which king Achaz died this word came. 
29| Rejoice not, all ye Philistines, because the yoke of him that smote you is broken: for out of the seed of the serpent shall come forth the young asps, and their young shall come forth flying serpents, 
30| And the poor shall be fed by him, and poor men shall rest in peace: but he shall destroy thy seed with hunger, and shall destroy thy remnant. 
31| Howl, ye gates of cities; let the cities be troubled and cry, <i>even</i> all the Philistines: for smoke is coming from the north, and there is no <i>possibility</i> of living. 
32| And what shall the kings of the nations answer? That the Lord has founded Sion, and by him the poor of the people shall be saved. 

#15
1| THE WORD AGAINST THE LAND OF MOAB. By night the land of Moab shall be destroyed; for by night the wall of the land of Moab shall be destroyed. 
2| Grieve for yourselves; for even Debon, where your altar is, shall be destroyed: thither shall ye go up to weep, over Nabau of the land of Moab: howl ye: baldness shall be on every head, <i>and</i> all arms <i>shall be</i> wounded. 
3| Gird yourselves with sackcloth in her streets: and lament upon her roofs, and in her streets, and in her ways; howl all of you with weeping. 
4| For Esebon and Eleale have cried: their voice was heard to Jassa: therefore the loins of the region of Moab cry aloud; her soul shall know. 
5| The heart of the region of Moab cries within her to Segor; for it is <i>as</i> a heifer of three years old: and on the ascent of Luith they shall go up to thee weeping by the way of Aroniim: she cries, Destruction, and trembling.
 6| The water of Nemerim shall be desolate, and the grass thereof shall fail: for there shall be no green grass. 
7| Shall <i>Moab</i> even thus be delivered? for I <i>will</i> bring the Arabians upon the valley, and they shall take it. 
8| For the cry has reached the border of the region of Moab, <i>even</i> of Agalim; and her howling <i>has gone</i> as far as the well of Ælim. 
9| And the water of Dimon shall be filled with blood: for I will bring Arabians upon Dimon, and I will take away the seed of Moab, and Ariel, and the remnant of Adama. 

#16
1| I will send as it were reptiles on the land: is <i>not</i> the mount of the daughter of Sion a desolate rock? 
2| For thou shalt be as a young bird taken away from a bird that has flown: <i>even</i> thou shalt be <i>so</i>, daughter of Moab: and then do thou, O Arnon, 
3| take farther counsel, and continually make thou a shelter from grief: they flee in darkness at mid-day; they are amazed; be not thou led captive. 
4| The fugitives of Moab shall sojourn with thee; they shall be to you a shelter from the face of the pursuer: for thine alliance has been taken away, and the oppressing ruler has perished from off the earth. 
5| And a throne shall be established with mercy; and one shall sit upon it with truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and earnestly seeking judgments, and hasting righteousness.
6| We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud. I have cut off his pride: thy prophecy shall not be thus, <i>no</i> not thus. 
7| Moab shall howl; for all shall howl in the land of Moab: but thou shalt care for them that dwell in Seth, and thou shalt not be ashamed. 
8| The plains of Esebon shall mourn, the vine of Sebama: swallowing up the nations, trample ye her vines, even to Jazer: ye shall not come together; wander ye in the desert: they that were sent are deserted, for they have gone over to the sea. 
9| Therefore will I weep as with the weeping of Jazer for the vine of Sebama; Esebon and Eleale have cast down thy trees; for I will trample on thy harvest and on thy vintages, and all <i>thy plants</i> shall fall. 
10| And gladness and rejoicing shall be taken away from the vineyards; and they shall not at all tread wine into the vats; for <i>the vintage</i> has ceased. 
11| Therefore my belly shall sound as a harp for Moab, and thou hast repaired my inward parts as a wall. 
12| And it shall be to thy shame, (for Moab is wearied at the altars,) that he shall go in to the idols thereof to pray, but they shall not be at all able to deliver him. 
13| This is the word which the Lord spoke against Moab, when he spoke. 
14| And now I say, in three years, of the years of an hireling, the glory of Moab shall be dishonoured <i>with</i> all his great wealth; and he shall be left few in number, and not honoured. 

#17
1| THE WORD AGAINST DAMASCUS. Behold, Damascus shall be taken away from among cities, and shall become a ruin; 
2| abandoned for ever, to <i>be</i> a fold and resting-place for flocks, and there shall be none to go after them. 
3| And she shall no longer be a strong place for Ephraim to flee to, and there shall no longer be a kingdom in Damascus, or a remnant of Syrians; for thou art no better than the children of Israel, <i>even</i> than their glory; thus saith the Lord of hosts. 
4| There shall be in that day a failure of the glory of Jacob, and the riches of his glory shall be shaken. 
5| And it shall be as if one should gather standing corn, and reap the grain of the ears; and it shall be as if one should gather ears in a rich valley; 
6|  and <i>as if</i> there should be left stubble therein, or <i>as it were</i> the berries of an olive tree, two or three on the topmost bough, or <i>as if</i> four or five should be left on their branches; thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel. 
7| In that day a man shall trust in him that made him, and his eyes shall have respect to the Holy One of Israel. 
8| And they shall not at all trust in their altars, nor in the works of their hands, which their fingers made; and they shall not look to the trees, nor to their abominations.
9| In that day thy cities shall be deserted, as the Amorites and the Evaeans deserted <i>theirs</i>, because of the children of Israel; and they shall be desolate. 
10| Because thou hast forsaken God thy Saviour, and hast not been mindful of the Lord thy helper; therefore shalt thou plant a false plant, and a false seed. 
11| In the day wherein thou shalt plant thou shalt be deceived; but if thou sow in the morning, <i>the seed</i> shall spring up for a crop in the day wherein thou shalt obtain an inheritance, and as a man’s father, thou shalt obtain an inheritance for thy sons.
12| Woe <i>to</i> the multitude of many nations, as the swelling sea, so shall ye be confounded; and the force of many nations shall sound like water; 
13| many nations like much water, as when much water rushes violently: and they shall drive him away, and pursue him afar, as the dust of chaff when men winnow before the wind, and as a storm whirling the dust of the wheel. 
14| Toward evening, and there shall be grief; before the morning, and he shall not be. This is the portion of them that spoiled you, and the inheritance to them that robbed you of your inheritance. 

#18
1| Woe to you, ye wings of the land of ships, beyond the rivers of Ethiopia. 
2| He sends messengers by the sea, and paper letters on the water: for swift messengers shall go to a lofty nation, and to a strange and harsh people. Who is beyond it? a nation not looked for, and trodden down. 
3| Now all the rivers of the land shall be inhabited as an inhabited country; their land shall be as when a signal is raised from a mountain; it shall be audible as the sound of a trumpet. 
4| For thus said the Lord to me, There shall be security in my city, as the light of noonday heat, and it shall be as a cloud of dew in the day of harvest. 
5| Before the reaping time, when the flower has been completely formed, and the unripe grape has put forth its flower and blossomed, then shall he take away the little clusters with pruning-hooks, and shall take away the small branches, and cut them off; 
6| And he shall leave <i>them</i> together to the birds of the sky, and to the wild beasts of the earth: and the fowls of the sky shall be gathered upon them, and all the beasts of the land shall come upon him. 
7| In that time shall presents be brought to the Lord of hosts from a people afflicted and peeled, and from a people great from henceforth and for ever; a nation hoping and <i>yet</i> trodden down, which is in a part of a river of his land, to the place where is the name of the Lord of hosts, the mount Sion. 

#19
1| THE VISION OF EGYPT. Behold, the Lord sits on a swift cloud, and shall come to Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall be moved at his presence, and their heart shall faint within them. 
2| And the Egyptians shall be stirred up against the Egyptians: and a man shall fight against his brother, and a man against his neighbor, city against city, and law against law. 
3| And the spirit of the Egyptians shall be troubled within them; and I will frustrate their counsel: and they shall enquire of their gods and their images, and them that speak out of the earth, and them that have in them a divining spirit. 
4| And I will deliver Egypt into the hands of men, of cruel lords; and cruel kings shall rule over them: thus saith the Lord of hosts. 
5| And the Egyptians shall drink the water that is by the sea, but the river shall fail, and be dried up. 
6| And the streams shall fail, and the canals of the river; and every reservoir of water shall be dried up, in every marsh also of reed and papyrus. 
7| And all the green herbage round about the river, and everything sown by the side of the river, shall be blasted with the wind and dried up. 
8| And the fishermen shall groan, and all that cast a hook into the river shall groan; they also that cast nets, and the anglers shall mourn. 
9| And shame shall come upon them that work fine flax, and them that make fine linen. 
10| And they that work at them shall be in pain, and all that make beer shall be grieved, and be pained in their souls. 
11| And the princes of Tanis shall be fools: <i>as for</i> the king’s wise counsellors, their counsel shall be turned into folly: how will ye say to the king, we are sons of wise men, sons of ancient kings? 
12| Where are now thy wise men? and let them declare to thee, and say, What has the Lord of hosts purposed upon Egypt? 
13| The princes of Tanis have failed, and the princes of Memphis are lifted up <i>with pride</i>, and they shall cause Egypt to wander by tribes. 
14| For the Lord has prepared for them a spirit of error, and they have caused Egypt to err in all their works, as one staggers who is drunken and vomits also. 
15| And there shall be no work to the Egyptians, which shall make head or tail, or beginning or end. 
16| But in that day the Egyptians shall be as women, in fear and in trembling because of the hand of the Lord of hosts, which he shall bring upon them. 
17| And the land of the Jews shall be for a terror to the Egyptians: whosoever shall name it to them, they shall fear, because of the counsel which the Lord of hosts has purposed concerning it. 
18| In that day there shall be five cities in Egypt speaking the language of Chanaan, and swearing by the name of the Lord of hosts; one city shall be called the city of Asedec. 
19| In that day there shall be an altar to the Lord in the land of the Egyptians, and a pillar to the Lord by its border. 
20| And it shall be for a sign to the Lord for ever in the land of Egypt: for they shall presently cry to the Lord by reason of them that afflict them, and he shall send them a man who shall save them; he shall judge and save them. 
21| And the Lord shall be known to the Egyptians, and the Egyptians shall know the Lord in that day; and they shall offer sacrifices, and shall vow vows to the Lord, and pay <i>them</i>. 
22| And the Lord shall smite the Egyptians with a stroke, and shall completely heal them: and they shall return to the Lord, and he shall hear them, and thoroughly heal them. 
23| In that day there shall be a way from Egypt to the Assyrians, and the Assyrians shall enter into Egypt, and the Egyptians shall go to the Assyrians, and the Egyptians shall serve the Assyrians. 
24| In that day shall Israel be third with the Egyptians and the Assyrians, blessed in the land which the Lord of hosts has blessed, 
25| saying, Blessed be my people that is in Egypt, and that is among the Assyrians, and Israel mine inheritance. 

#20
1| In the year when Tanathan came to Azotus, when he was sent by Arna king of the Assyrians, and warred against Azotus, and took it; 
2| then the Lord spoke to Esaias the son of Amos, saying, Go and take the sackcloth off thy loins, and loose thy sandals from off thy feet, and do thus, going naked and barefoot. 
3| And the Lord said, As my servant Esaias has walked naked and barefoot three years, there shall be three years for signs and wonders to the Egyptians and Ethiopians; 
4| for thus shall the king of the Assyrians lead the captivity of Egypt and the Ethiopians, young men and old, naked and barefoot, having the shame of Egypt exposed. 
5| And the Egyptians being defeated shall be ashamed of the Ethiopians, in whom they had trusted; for they were their glory. 
6| And they that dwell in this island shall say in that day, Behold, we trusted to flee to them for help, who could not save themselves from the king of the Assyrians: and how shall we be saved?1 

#21
1| THE VISION OF THE DESERT. As though a whirlwind should pass through the desert, coming from a desert, <i>even</i> from such a land, 
2| <i>so</i> a fearful and a grievous vision was declared to me: he that is treacherous deals treacherously, the transgressor transgresses. The Elamites are upon me, and the ambassadors of the Persians come against me: now will I groan and comfort myself. 
3| Therefore are my loins filled with feebleness, and pangs have seized me as a travailing woman: I dealt wrongfully that I might not hear; I hasted that I might not see. 
4| My heart wanders, and transgression overwhelms me; my soul is occupied with fear. 
5| Prepare the table, eat, drink: arise, ye princes, and prepare <i>your</i> shields. 
6| For thus said the Lord to me, Go and station a watchman for thyself, and declare whatever thou shalt see. 
7| And I saw two mounted horsemen, and a rider on an ass, and a rider on a camel. 
8| Hearken with great attention, and call thou Urias to the watch-tower: the Lord has spoken. I stood continually during the day, and I stood in the camp all night: 
9| and, behold, he comes riding in a chariot and pair: and he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is fallen; and all her images and her idols have been crushed to the ground. 
10| Hear, ye that are left, and ye that are in pain, hear what things I have heard of the Lord of hosts <i>which</i> the God of Israel has declared to us.THE VISION OF IDUMEA. 
11|  Call to me out of Seir; guard ye the bulwarks. 
12| I watch in the morning and the night: if thou wouldest enquire, enquire, and dwell by me. 
13| Thou mayest lodge in the forest in the evening, or in the way of Daedan. 
14| Ye that dwell in the country of Thaeman, bring water to meet him that is thirsty; 
15| meet the fugitives with bread, because of the multitude of the slain, and because of the multitude of them that lose their way, and because of the multitude of swords, and because of the multitude of bent bows, and because of the multitude of them that have fallen in war. 
16| For thus said the Lord to me, Yet a year, as the year of an hireling, <i>and</i> the glory of the sons of Kedar shall fail: 
17| and the remnant of the strong bows of the sons of Kedar shall be small: for the Lord God of Israel has spoken <i>it</i>.

1| THE WORD OF THE VALLEY OF SION. What has happened to thee, that now ye are all gone up to the housetops which help you not? 
2| The city is filled with shouting <i>men</i>: thy slain are not slain with swords, nor are thy dead those who have died in battle. 
3| All thy princes have fled, and <i>thy</i> captives are tightly bound, and the mighty <i>men</i> in thee have fled far away. 
4| Therefore I said, Let me alone, I will weep bitterly; labour not to comfort me for the breach of the daughter of my people. 
5| For <i>it is</i> a day of trouble, and of destruction, and of treading down, and <i>there is</i> perplexity <i>sent</i> from the Lord of hosts: they wander in the valley of Sion; they wander from the least to the greatest on the mountains. 
6| And the Elamites took <i>their</i> quivers, and <i>there were</i> men mounted on horses, and <i>there was</i> a gathering for battle. 
7| And it shall be <i>that</i> thy choice valleys shall be filled with chariots, and horsemen shall block up thy gates. 
8| And they shall uncover the gates of Juda, and they shall look in that day on the choice houses of the city. 
9| And they shall uncover the secret places of the houses of the citadel of David: and they saw that they were many, and that one <i>had</i> turned the water of the old pool into the city; 
10| and that they <i>had</i> pulled down the houses of Jerusalem, to fortify the wall of the city. 
11| And ye procured to yourselves water between the two walls within the ancient pool: but ye looked not to him that made it from the beginning, and regarded not him that created it. 
12| And the Lord, the Lord of hosts, called in that day for weeping, and lamentation, and baldness, and for girding with sackcloth: 
13| but they engaged in joy and gladness, slaying calves, and killing sheep, so as to eat flesh, and drink wine; saying, Let us eat and drink; for to-morrow we die. 
14| And these things are revealed in the ears of the Lord of hosts: for this sin shall not be forgiven you, until ye die.
15| Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Go into the chamber, to Somnas the treasurer, and say to him, Why art thou here? 
16| and what hast thou to do here, that thou hast here hewn thyself a sepulchre, and madest thyself a sepulchre on high, and hast graven for thyself a dwelling in the rock? 
17| Behold now, the Lord of hosts casts forth and will utterly destroy <i>such</i> a man, and will take away thy robe and thy glorious crown, 
18| and will cast thee into a great and unmeasured land, and there thou shalt die: and he will bring thy fair chariot to shame, and the house of thy prince to be trodden down. 
19| And thou shalt be removed from thy stewardship, and from thy place. 
20| And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my servant Eliakim the son of Chelcias: 
21| and I will put on him thy robe, and I will grant him thy crown with power, and I will give thy stewardship into his hands: and he shall be as a father to them that dwell in Jerusalem, and to them that dwell in Juda. 
22| And I will give him the glory of David; and he shall rule, and there shall be none to speak against him: and I will give him the key of the house of David <i>upon</i> his shoulder; and he shall open, and there shall be none to shut; and he shall shut, and there shall be none to open. 
23| And I will make him a ruler in a sure place, and he shall be for a glorious throne of his father’s house. 
24| And every one that is glorious in the house of his father shall trust in him, from the least to the greatest; and they shall depend upon him in that day. 
25| Thus saith the Lord of hosts, The man that is fastened in the sure place shall be removed and be taken away, and shall fall; and the glory that is upon him shall be utterly destroyed: for the Lord has spoken it.

1| THE WORD CONCERNING TYRE. Howl, ye ships of Carthage; for she has perished, and <i>men</i> no longer arrive from the land of the Citians: she is led captive. 
2| To whom are the dwellers in the island become like, the merchants of Phoenice, passing over the sea 
3| in great waters, a generation of merchants? as when the harvest is gathered in, <i>so are</i> these traders with the nations. 
4| Be ashamed, O Sidon: the sea has said, yea, the strength of the sea has said, I have not travailed, nor brought forth, nor have I brought up young men, nor reared virgins. 
5| Moreover when it shall be heard in Egypt, sorrow shall seize them for Tyre. 
6| Depart ye to Carthage; howl, ye that dwell in this island. 
7| Was not this your pride from the beginning, before she was given up? 
8| Who has devised this counsel against Tyre? Is she inferior? or has she no strength? her merchants were the glorious princes of the earth. 
9| The Lord of hosts has purposed to bring down all the pride of the glorious ones, and to disgrace every glorious thing on the earth. 
10| Till thy land; for ships no more come out of Carthage. 
11| And thy hand prevails no more by sea, which troubled kings: the Lord of hosts has given a command concerning Chanaan, to destroy the strength thereof. 
12| And <i>men</i> shall say, Ye shall no longer at all continue to insult and injure the daughter of Sidon: and if thou depart to the Citians, neither there shalt thou have rest. 
13| And <i>if thou depart</i> to the land of the Chaldeans, this also is laid waste by the Assyrians, for her wall is fallen. 
14| Howl, ye ships of Carthage: for your strong hold is destroyed.
15| And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> Tyre shall be left seventy years, as the time of a king, as the time of a man: and it shall come to pass after seventy years, <i>that</i> Tyre shall be as the song of a harlot. 
16| Take a harp, go about, O city, thou harlot that hast been forgotten; play well on the harp, sing many <i>songs</i>, that thou mayest be remembered. 
17| And it shall come to pass after the seventy years, <i>that</i> God will visit Tyre, and she shall be again restored to her primitive state, and she shall be a mart for all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. 
18| And her trade and her gain shall be holiness to the Lord: it shall not be gathered for them, but for those that dwell before the Lord, <i>even</i> all her trade, to eat and drink and be filled, and for a covenant <i>and</i> a memorial before the Lord. 

#24
1| Behold, the Lord is about to lay waste the world, and will make it desolate, and will lay bare the surface of it, and scatter them that dwell therein. 
2| And the people shall be as the priest, and the servant as the lord, and the maid as the mistress; the buyer shall be as the seller, the lender as the borrower, and the debtor as his creditor. 
3| The earth shall be completely laid waste, and the earth shall be utterly spoiled: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken these things. 
4| The earth mourns, and the world is ruined, the lofty ones of the earth are mourning. 
5| And she has sinned by reason of her inhabitants; because they have transgressed the law, and changed the ordinances, <i>even</i> the everlasting covenant. 
6| Therefore a curse shall consume the earth, because the inhabitants thereof have sinned: therefore the dwellers in the earth shall be poor, and few men shall be left. 
7| The wine shall mourn, the vine shall mourn, all the merry-hearted shall sigh. 
8| The mirth of timbrels has ceased, the sound of the harp has ceased. 
9| They are ashamed, they have not drunk wine; strong drink has become bitter to them that drink <i>it</i>. 
10| All the city has become desolate: one shall shut his house so that none shall enter. 
11| There is a howling for the wine everywhere; all the mirth of the land has ceased, all the mirth of the land has departed. 
12| And cities shall be left desolate, and houses being left shall fall to ruin.
13| All this shall be in the land in the midst of the nations, as if one should strip an olive tree, so shall they strip them; but when the vintage is done, 
14| these shall cry aloud; and they that are left on the land shall rejoice together in the glory of the Lord: the water of the sea shall be troubled. 
15| Therefore shall the glory of the Lord be in the isles of the sea; the name of the Lord shall be glorious.
16| O Lord God of Israel, from the ends of the earth we have heard wonderful things, <i>and there is</i> hope to the godly: but they shall say, Woe to the despisers, that despise the law. 
17| Fear, and a pit, and a snare, are upon you that dwell on the earth. 
18| And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> he that flees from the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that comes up out of the pit shall be caught by the snare: for windows have been opened in heaven, and the foundations of the earth shall be shaken, 
19| the earth shall be utterly confounded, and the earth shall be completely perplexed. 
20| It reels as a drunkard and one oppressed with wine, and the earth shall be shaken as a storehouse of fruits; for iniquity has prevailed upon it, and it shall fall, and shall not be able to rise. 
21| And God shall bring <i>his</i> hand upon the host of heaven, and upon the kings of the earth. 
22| And they shall gather the multitude thereof into prisons, and they shall shut them into a strong hold: after many generations they shall be visited. 
23| And the brick shall decay, and the wall shall fall; for the Lord shall reign from out of Sion, and out of Jerusalem, and shall be glorified before <i>his</i> elders. 

#25
1| O Lord God, I will glorify thee, I will sing to thy name; for thou hast done wonderful things, <i>even</i> an ancient <i>and</i> faithful counsel. So be it. 
2| For thou hast made cities a heap, <i>even</i> cities <i>made</i> strong that their foundations should not fall: the city of ungodly men shall not be built for ever. 
3| Therefore shall the poor people bless thee, and cities of injured men shall bless thee. 
4| For thou hast been a helper to every lowly city, and a shelter to them that were disheartened by reason of poverty: thou shalt deliver them from wicked men: <i>thou hast been</i> a shelter of them that thirst, and a refreshing air to injured men. 
5| <i>We were</i> as faint-hearted men thirsting in Sion, by reason of ungodly men to whom thou didst deliver us. 
6| And the Lord of hosts shall make <i>a feast</i> for all the nations: on this mount they shall drink gladness, they shall drink wine: 
7| they shall anoint themselves with ointment in this mountain. Impart thou all these things to the nations; for this is <i>God’s</i> counsel upon all the nations. 
8| Death has prevailed and swallowed <i>men</i> up; but again the Lord God has taken away every tear from every face. He has taken away the reproach of <i>his</i> people from all the earth: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken it. 
9| And in that day they shall say, behold our God in whom we have trusted, and he shall save us: this <i>is</i> the Lord; we have waited for him, and we have exulted, and will rejoice in our salvation. 
10| God will give rest on this mountain, and the country of Moab shall be trodden down, as they tread the floor with waggons. 
11| And he shall spread forth his hands, even as he also brings down <i>man</i> to destroy <i>him</i>: and he shall bring low his pride <i>in regard to the thing</i> on which he has laid his hands. 
12| And he shall bring down the height of the refuge of the wall, and it shall come down even to the ground. 

#26
1| In that day they shall sing this song in the land of Judea; Behold a strong city; and he shall make salvation <i>its</i> wall and bulwark. 
2| Open ye the gates, let the nation enter that keeps righteousness, and keeps truth, 
3| supporting truth, and keeping peace: for on thee, O Lord, 
4| they have trusted with confidence for ever, the great, the eternal God; 
5| who hast humbled and brought down them that dwell on high, thou shalt cast down strong cities, and bring them to the ground. 
6| And the feet of the meek and lowly shall trample them. 
7| The way of the godly is made straight: the way of the godly is also prepared. 
8| For the way of the Lord is judgment: we have hoped in thy name, and on the remembrance <i>of thee</i>, 
9| which our soul longs for: my spirit seeks thee very early in the morning, O God, for thy commandments are a light on the earth: learn righteousness, ye that dwell upon the earth. 
10| For the ungodly one is put down: no one who will not learn righteousness on the earth, shall be able to do the truth: let the ungodly be taken away, that he see not the glory of the Lord. 
11| O Lord, thine arm is exalted, yet they knew it not: but when they know they shall be ashamed: jealousy shall seize upon an untaught nation, and now fire shall devour the adversaries.
 12| O Lord our God, give us peace: for thou hast rendered to us all things. 
13| O Lord our God, take possession of us: O Lord, we know not <i>any</i> other beside thee: we name thy name. 
14| But the dead shall not see life, neither shall physicians by any means raise <i>them</i> up: therefore thou hast brought <i>wrath</i> upon <i>them</i>, and slain <i>them</i>, and hast taken away every male of them. Bring more evils upon them, O Lord; 
15| bring more evils on the glorious ones of the earth. 
16| Lord, in affliction I remembered thee; thy chastening was to us with small affliction. 
17| And as a woman in travail draws nigh to be delivered, <i>and</i> cries out in her pain; so have we been to thy beloved. 
18| We have conceived, O Lord, because of thy fear, and have been in pain, and have brought forth the breath of thy salvation, which we have wrought upon the earth: we shall not fall, but all that dwell upon the land shall fall. 
19| The dead shall rise, and they that are in the tombs shall be raised, and they that are in the earth shall rejoice: for the dew from thee is healing to them: but the land of the ungodly shall perish. 
20| Go, my people, enter into thy closets, shut thy door, hide thyself for a little season, until the anger of the Lord have passed away. 
21| For, behold, the Lord is bringing wrath from <i>his</i> holy place upon the dwellers on the earth: the earth also shall disclose her blood, and shall not cover her slain. 

#27
1| In that day God shall bring <i>his</i> holy and great and strong sword upon the dragon, even the serpent that flees, upon the dragon, the crooked serpent: he shall destroy the dragon. 
2| In that day <i>there shall be</i> a fair vineyard, <i>and</i> a desire to commence <i>a song</i> concerning it. 
3| I am a strong city, a city in a siege: in vain shall I water it; for it shall be taken by night, and by day the wall shall fall. 
4| There is no woman that has not taken hold of it; who will set me to watch stubble in the field? because of this enemy I have set her aside; therefore on this account the Lord has done all that he appointed. 
5| I am burnt up; they that dwell in her shall cry, Let us make peace with him, let us make peace, 
6| they that are coming are the children of Jacob. Israel shall bud and blossom, and the world shall be filled with his fruit.
7| Shall he himself be thus smitten, even as he smote? and as he slew, shall he be thus slain? 
8| Fighting and reproaching he will dismiss them; didst thou not meditate with a harsh spirit, to slay them with a wrathful spirit? 
9| Therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be taken away; and this is his blessing, when I shall have taken away his sin; when they shall have broken to pieces all the stones of the altars as fine dust, and their trees shall not remain, and their idols shall be cut off, as a thicket afar off. 
10| The flock that dwelt <i>there</i> shall be left, as a deserted flock; and <i>the ground</i> shall be for a long time for pasture, and there shall flocks lie down to rest. 
11| And after a time there shall be in it no green thing because of <i>the grass</i> being parched. Come hither, ye women that come from a sight; for it is a people of no understanding; therefore he that made them shall have no pity upon them, and he that formed them shall have no mercy <i>upon them</i>. 
12| And it shall come to pass in that day <i>that</i> God shall fence <i>men</i> off from the channel of the river as far as Rhinocorura; but do ye gather one by one the children of Israel. 
13| And it shall come to pass in that day <i>that</i> they shall blow the great trumpet, and the lost ones in the land of the Assyrians shall come, and the lost ones in Egypt, and shall worship the Lord on the holy mountain in Jerusalem. 

#28
1| Woe to the crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, the flower that has fallen from the glory of the top of the fertile mountain, they that are drunken without wine. 
2| Behold, the anger of the Lord is strong and severe, as descending hail where there is no shelter, violently descending; as a great body of water sweeping away the soil, he shall make rest for the land. 
3| The crown of pride, the hirelings of Ephraim, shall be beaten down with the hands and with the feet. 
4| And the fading flower of the glorious hope on the top of the high mountain shall be as the early fig; he that sees it, before he takes it into his hand, will desire to swallow it down. 
5| In that day the Lord of hosts shall be the crown of hope, the woven <i>crown</i> of glory, to the remnant of the people. 
6| They shall be left in the spirit of judgment for judgment, and for the strength of them that hinder slaying. 
7| For these have trespassed through wine; they have erred through strong drink: the priest and the prophet are mad through strong drink, they are swallowed up by reason of wine, they have staggered through drunkenness; they have erred: this is <i>their</i> vision. 
8| A curse shall devour this counsel, for this <i>is their</i> counsel for the sake of covetousness. 
9| To whom have we reported evils? and to whom have we reported a message? <i>even to those</i> that are weaned from the milk, who are drawn from the breast. 
10| Expect thou affliction on affliction, hope upon hope: yet a little, <i>and</i> yet a little, 
11| by reason of the contemptuous <i>words</i> of the lips, by means of another language: for they shall speak to this people, saying to them, 
12| This is the rest to him that is hungry, and this is the calamity: but they would not hear. 
13| Therefore the oracle of God shall be to them affliction on affliction, hope on hope, yet a little, <i>and</i> yet a little, that they may go and fall backward; and they shall be crushed and shall be in danger, and shall be taken.
14| Therefore hear ye the word of the Lord, ye afflicted men, and ye princes of this people that is in Jerusalem. 
15| Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with Hades, and agreements with death; if the rushing storm should pass, it shall not come upon us: we have made falsehood our hope, and by falsehood shall we be protected: 
16| Therefore thus saith the Lord, <i>even</i> the Lord, Behold, I lay for the foundations of Sion a costly stone, a choice, a corner-stone, a precious <i>stone</i>, for its foundations; and he that believes <i>on him</i> shall by no means be ashamed. 
17| And I will cause judgment <i>to be</i> for hope, and my compassion shall be for <i>just</i> measures, and ye that trust vainly in falsehood <i>shall fall</i>: for the storm shall by no means pass by you, 
18| except it also take away your covenant of death, and your trust in Hades shall by no means stand: if the rushing storm should come upon you, ye shall be beaten down by it. 
19| Whenever it shall pass by, it shall take you; morning by morning it shall pass by in the day, and in the night there shall be an evil hope. Learn to hear, 
20| ye that are distressed; we cannot fight, but we are ourselves too weak for you to be gathered. 
21| The Lord shall rise up as a mountain of ungodly <i>men</i>, and shall be in the valley of Gabaon; he shall perform his works with wrath, <i>even</i> a work of bitterness, and his wrath shall deal strangely, and his destruction shall be strange. 
22| Therefore do not ye rejoice, neither let your bands be made strong; for I have heard of works finished and cut short by the Lord of hosts, which he will execute upon all the earth.
23| Hearken, and hear my voice; attend, and hear my words. 
24| Will the ploughman plough all the day? or will he prepare the seed beforehand, before he tills the ground? 
25| Does he not, when he has levelled the surface thereof, then sow the small black poppy, or cumin, and afterward sow wheat, and barley, and millet, and bread-corn in thy borders? 
26| So thou shalt be chastened by the judgment of thy God, and shalt rejoice. 
27| For the black poppy is not cleansed with harsh treatment, nor will a wagon-wheel pass over the cumin; but the black poppy is threshed with a rod, and the cumin shall be eaten with bread; 
28| for I will not be wroth with you for ever, neither shall the voice of my anger crush you. 
29| And these signs came forth from the Lord of hosts. Take counsel, exalt vain comfort. 

#29
1| Alas for the city of Ariel, which David besieged. Gather ye fruits year by year; eat ye, for ye shall eat with Moab. 
2| For I will grievously afflict Ariel: and her strength and her wealth shall be mine. 
3| And I will compass thee about like David, and will raise a mound about thee, and set up towers round thee. 
4| And thy words shall be brought down to the earth, and thy words shall sink down to the earth, and thy voice shall be as they that speak out of the earth, and thy voice shall be lowered to the ground. 
5| But the wealth of the ungodly shall be as dust from a wheel, and the multitude of them that oppress thee as flying chaff, and it shall be suddenly as a moment, 
6| from the Lord of Hosts: for there shall be a visitation with thunder, and earthquake, and a loud noise, a rushing tempest, and devouring flame of fire. 
7| And the wealth of all the nations together, as many as have fought against Ariel, and all they that war against Jerusalem, and all who are gathered against her, and they that distress her, shall be as one that dreams in sleep by night. 
8| And as men drink and eat in sleep, and when they have arisen, the dream is vain: and as a thirsty man dreams as if he drank, and having arisen is still thirsty, and his soul has desired in vain: so shall be the wealth of all the nations, as many as have fought against the mount Sion.
9| Faint ye, and be amazed, and be overpowered, not with strong drink nor with wine. 
10| For the Lord has made you to drink a spirit of deep sleep; and he shall close their eyes, and <i>the eyes</i> of their prophets and of their rulers, who see secret things. 
11| And all these things shall be to you as the words of this sealed book, which if they shall give to a learned man, saying, Read this, he shall then say, I cannot read <i>it</i>, for it is sealed. 
12| And this book shall be given into the hands of a man that is unlearned, and <i>one</i> shall say to him, Read this; and he shall say, I am not learned. 
13| And the Lord has said, This people draw nigh to me with their mouth, and they honour me with their lips, but their heart is far from me: but in vain do they worship me, teaching the commandments and doctrines of men. 
14| Therefore behold I will proceed to remove this people, and I will remove them: and I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and will hide the understanding of the prudent. 
15| Woe to them that deepen their counsel, and not by the Lord. Woe to them that take secret counsel, and whose works are in darkness, and they say, Who has seen us? and who shall know us, or what we do? 
16| Shall ye not be counted as clay of the potter? Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Thou didst not form me? or the work to the maker, Thou hast not made me wisely? 
17| <i>Is it</i> not yet a little while, and Libanus shall be changed as the mountains of Chermel, and Chermel shall be reckoned as a forest? 
18| And in that day the deaf shall hear the words of the book, and they that are in darkness, and they that are in mist: the eyes of the blind shall see, 
19| and the poor shall rejoice with joy because of the Lord, and they that had no hope among men shall be filled with joy. 
20| The lawless man has come to nought, and the proud man has perished, and they that transgress mischievously have been utterly destroyed: 
21| and they that cause men to sin by a word: and men shall make all that reprove in the gates an offence, because they have unjustly turned aside the righteous. 
22| Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the house of Jacob, whom he set apart from Abraam, Jacob shall not now be ashamed, neither shall he now change countenance. 
23| But when their children shall have seen my works, they shall sanctify my name for my sake, and they sanctify the Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel. 
24| And they that erred in spirit shall know understanding, and the murmurers shall learn obedience, and the stammering tongues shall learn to speak peace. 

#30
1| Woe to the apostate children, saith the Lord: ye have framed counsel, not by me, and covenants not by my Spirit, to add sins to sins: 
2| <i>even</i> they that proceed to go down into Egypt, but they have not enquired of me, that they might be helped by Pharao, and protected by the Egyptians. 
3| For the protection of Pharaoh shall be to you a disgrace, and <i>there shall be</i> a reproach to them that trust in Egypt. 
4| For there are princes in Tanes, evil messengers. 
5| In vain shall they labour <i>in seeking</i> to a people, which shall not profit them for help, but <i>shall be</i> for a shame and reproach. 
6| THE VISION OF THE QUADRUPEDS IN THE DESERT. In affliction and distress, <i>where are</i> the lion and lion’s whelp, thence <i>come</i> also asps, and the young of flying asps, <i>there shall they be</i> who bore their wealth on asses and camels to a nation which shall not profit them. 
7| The Egyptians shall help you utterly in vain: tell them, This your consolation is vain.
8| Now then sit down and write these words on a tablet, and in a book; for these things shall be for <i>many long</i> days, and even for ever. 
9| For the people is disobedient, false children, who would not hear the law of God: 
10| who say to the prophets, Report not to us; and to them that see visions, Speak <i>them</i> not to us, but speak and report to us another error; 
11| and turn us aside from this way; remove from us this path, and remove from us the oracle of Israel. 
12| Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye have refused to obey these words, and have trusted in falsehood; and because thou hast murmured, and been confident in this respect: 
13| therefore shall this sin be to you as a wall suddenly falling when a strong city has been taken, of which the fall is very near at hand. 
14| And the fall thereof shall be as the breaking of an earthen vessel, <i>as</i> small fragments of a pitcher, so that thou shouldest not find among them a sherd, with which thou mightest take up fire, and with which thou shouldest draw a little water. 
15| Thus saith the Lord, the Holy Lord of Israel; When thou shalt turn and mourn, then thou shalt be saved; and thou shalt know where thou wast, when thou didst trust in vanities: <i>then</i> your strength became vain, yet ye would not hearken: 
16| but ye said, We will flee upon horses; therefore shall ye flee: and, We will be aided by swift riders; therefore shall they that pursue you be swift. 
17| A thousand shall flee because of the voice of one, and many shall flee on account of the voice of five; until ye be left as a signal-post upon a mountain, and as one bearing an ensign upon a hill.
18| And the Lord will again wait, that he may pity you, and will therefore be exalted that he may have mercy upon you: because the Lord your God is a judge: blessed are they that stay themselves upon him. 
19| For the holy people shall dwell in Sion: and <i>whereas</i> Jerusalem has wept bitterly, <i>saying</i>, Pity me; he shall pity thee: when he perceived the voice of thy cry, he hearkened to thee. 
20| And <i>though</i> the Lord shall give you the bread of affliction and scant water, yet they that cause thee to err shall no more at all draw nigh to thee; for thine eyes shall see those that cause thee to err, 
21| and thine ears shall hear the words of them that went after thee to lead thee astray, who say, This <i>is</i> the way, let us walk in it, whether to the right or to the left. 
22| And thou shalt pollute the plated idols, and thou shalt grind to powder the gilt ones, and shalt scatter them as the water of a removed <i>woman</i>, and thou shalt thrust them forth as dung. 
23| Then shall there be rain to the seed of thy land; and the bread of the fruit of thy land shall be plenteous and rich: and thy cattle shall feed in that day in a fertile and spacious place. 
24| Your bulls and your oxen that till the ground, shall eat chaff mixed with winnowed barley. 
25| And there shall be upon every lofty mountain and upon every high hill, water running in that day, when many shall perish, and when the towers shall fall. 
26| And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold in the day when the Lord shall heal the breach of his people, and shall heal the pain of thy wound.
27| Behold, the name of the Lord comes after a <i>long</i> time, burning wrath: the word of his lips is with glory, a word full of anger, and the anger of his wrath shall devour as fire. 
28| And his breath, as rushing water in a valley, shall reach as far as the neck, and be divided, to confound the nations for <i>their</i> vain error: error also shall pursue them, and overtake them. 
29| Must ye always rejoice, and go into my holy places continually, as they that keep a feast? and must ye go with a pipe, as those that rejoice, into the mountain of the Lord, to the God of Israel? 
30| And the Lord shall make his glorious voice to be heard, and the wrath of his arm, to make a display with wrath and anger and devouring flame: he shall lighten terribly, and <i>his wrath shall be</i> as water and violent hail. 
31| For by the voice of the Lord the Assyrians shall be overcome, <i>even</i> by the stroke wherewith he shall smite them. 
32| And it shall happen to him from every side, <i>that</i> they from whom their hope of assistance was, in which he trusted, themselves shall war against him in turn with drums and with harp. 
33| For thou shalt be required before <i>thy</i> time: has it been prepared for thee also to reign? nay, God has <i>prepared for thee</i> a deep trench, wood piled, fire and much wood: the wrath of the Lord <i>shall be</i> as a trench kindled with sulphur.

1| Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, who trust in horses and chariots, for they are many; and in horses, <i>which are</i> a great multitude; and have not trusted in the Holy One of Israel, and have not sought the Lord. 
2| Therefore he has wisely brought evils upon them, and his word shall not be frustrated; and he shall rise up against the houses of wicked men, and against their vain hope, 
3| <i>even</i> an Egyptian, a man, and not God; the flesh of horses, and there is no help <i>in them</i>: but the Lord shall bring his hand upon them, and the helpers shall fail, and all shall perish together. 
4| For thus said the Lord to me, As a lion would roar, or a lion’s whelp over prey which he has taken, and cry over it, until the mountains are filled with his voice, and <i>the animals</i> are awe-struck and tremble at the fierceness of his wrath: so the Lord of hosts shall descend to fight upon the mount Sion, <i>even</i> upon her mountains. 
5| As birds flying, so shall the Lord of hosts defend; he shall defend Jerusalem, and he shall rescue, and save and deliver. 
6| Turn, ye children of Israel, who devise a deep and sinful counsel. 
7| For in that day men shall renounce their silver idols and <i>their</i> golden idols, which their hands made. 
8| And the Assyrian shall fall: not the sword of a great man, nor the sword of a mean man shall devour him; neither shall he flee from the face of the sword: but the young men shall be overthrown: 
9| for they shall be compassed with rocks as with a trench, and shall be worsted; and he that flees shall be taken. Thus saith the Lord, Blesses is he that has a seed in Sion, and household friends in Jerusalem. 

#32
1| For, behold, a righteous king shall reign, and princes shall govern with judgment. 
2| And a man shall hide his words, and be hidden, as from rushing water, and shall appear in Sion as a rushing river, glorious in a thirsty land. 
3| And they shall no more trust in men, but they shall incline their ears to hear. 
4| And the heart of the weak ones shall attend to hear, and the stammering tongues shall soon learn to speak peace. 
5| And they shall no more at all tell a fool to rule, and thy servants shall no more at all say, Be silent. 
6| For the fool shall speak foolish words, and his heart shall meditate vanities, and to perform lawless deeds and to speak error against the Lord, to scatter hungry souls, and he will cause the thirsty souls to be empty. 
7| For the counsel of the wicked will devise iniquity, to destroy the poor with unjust words, and ruin the cause of the poor in judgment. 
8| But the godly have devised wise <i>measures</i>, and this counsel shall stand.
9| Rise up, ye rich women, and hear my voice; ye confident daughters, hearken to my words. 
10| Remember for a full year in pain, yet with hope: the vintage has been cut off; it has ceased, it shall by no means come again. 
11| Be amazed, be pained, ye confident ones: strip you, bare yourselves, gird your loins; 
12| and beat your breasts, because of the pleasant field, and the fruit of the vine. 
13| <i>As for</i> the land of my people, the thorn and grass shall come upon <i>it</i>, and joy shall be removed from every house. 
14| <i>As for</i> the rich city, the houses are deserted; they shall abandon the wealth of the city, <i>and</i> the pleasant houses: and the villages shall be caves for ever, the joy of wild asses, shepherds’ pastures; 
15| until the Spirit shall come upon you from on high, and Chermel shall be desert, and Chermel shall be counted for a forest. 
16| Then judgment shall abide in the wilderness, and righteousness shall dwell in Carmel. 
17| And the works of righteousness shall be peace; and righteousness shall ensure rest, and <i>the righteous</i> shall be confident for ever. 
18| And his people shall inhabit a city of peace, and dwell in <i>it</i> in confidence, and they shall rest with wealth. 
19| And if the hail should come down, it shall not come upon you; and they that dwell in the forests shall be in confidence, as those in the plain country. 
20| Blessed are they that sow by every water, where the ox and ass tread. 

#33
1| Woe to them that afflict you; but no one makes you miserable: and he that deals perfidiously with you does not deal perfidiously: they that deal perfidiously shall be taken and given up, and as a moth on a garment, so shall they be spoiled. 
2| Lord, have mercy upon us; for we have trusted in thee: the seed of the rebellious is gone to destruction, but our deliverance was in a time of affliction. 
3| By reason of the terrible sound the nations were dismayed for fear of thee, and the heathen were scattered. 
4| And now shall the spoils of your small and great be gathered: as if one should gather locusts, so shall they mock you. 
5| The God who dwells on high is holy: Sion is filled with judgment and righteousness. 
6| They shall be delivered up to the law: our salvation is our treasure: there are wisdom and knowledge and piety toward the Lord; these are the treasures of righteousness. 
7| Behold now, these shall be terrified with fear of you: those whom ye feared shall cry out because of you: messengers shall be sent, bitterly weeping, entreating for peace. 
8| For the ways of these shall be made desolate: the terror of the nations has been made to cease, and the covenant with these is taken away, and ye shall by no means deem them men. 
9| The land mourns; Libanus is ashamed: Saron is become marshes; Galilee shall be laid bare, and Chermel. 
10| Now will I arise, saith the Lord, now will I be glorified; now will I be exalted. 
11| Now shall ye see, now shall ye perceive; the strength of your breath, shall be vain; fire shall devour you. 
12| And the nations shall be burnt up; as a thorn in the field cast out and burnt up.
13| They that are afar off shall hear what I have done; they that draw nigh shall know my strength. 
14| The sinners in Sion have departed; trembling shall seize the ungodly. Who will tell you that a fire is kindled? Who will tell you of the eternal place? 
15| He that walks in righteousness, speaking rightly, hating transgression and iniquity, and shaking his hands from gifts, stopping his ears that he should not hear the judgment of blood, shutting his eyes that he should not see injustice. 
16| he shall dwell in a high cave of a strong rock: bread shall be given him, and his water shall be sure. 
17| Ye shall see a king with glory: your eyes shall behold a land from afar. 
18| Your soul shall meditate terror. Where are the scribes? where are the counsellors, where is he that numbers them that are growing up, 
19| <i>even</i> the small and great people? with whom he took not counsel, neither did he understand <i>a people</i> of deep speech, so that a despised people should not hear, and there is no understanding to him that hears. 
20| Behold the city of Sion, our refuge: thine eyes shall behold Jerusalem, a rich city, tabernacles which shall not be shaken, neither shall the pins of her tabernacle be moved for ever, neither shall her cords be at all broken: 
21| for the name of the Lord is great to you: ye shall have a place, <i>even</i> rivers and wide and spacious channels: thou shalt not go this way, neither a vessel with oars go <i>thereby</i>. 
22| For my God is great: the Lord our judge shall not pass me by: the Lord is our prince, the Lord is our king; the Lord, he shall save us. 
23| Thy cords are broken, for they had no strength: thy meat has given way, it shall not spread the sails, it shall not bear a signal, until it be given up for plunder; therefore shall many lame men take spoil. 
24| And the people dwelling among them shall by no means say, I am in pain: for their sin shall be forgiven them. 

#34
1| Draw near, ye nations; and hearken, ye princes; let the earth hear, and they that are in it; the world, and the people that are therein. 
2| For the wrath of the Lord is upon all nations, and <i>his</i> anger upon the number of them, to destroy them, and give them up to slaughter. 
3| And their slain shall be cast forth, and their corpses; and their <i>ill</i> savour shall come up, and the mountains shall be made wet with their blood. 
4| And all the powers of the heavens shall melt, and the sky shall be rolled up like a scroll: and all the stars shall fall like leaves from a vine, and as leaves fall from a fig-tree. 
5| My sword has been made drunk in heaven: behold, it shall come down upon Idumea, and with judgment upon the people doomed to destruction. 
6| The sword of the Lord is filled with blood, it is glutted with fat, with the blood of goats and lambs, and with the fat of goats and rams: for the Lord has a sacrifice in Bosor, and a great slaughter in Idumea. 
7| And the mighty ones shall fall with them, and the rams and the bulls; and the land shall be soaked with blood, and shall be filled with their fat. 
8| For it is the day of judgment of the Lord, and the year of the recompence of Sion in judgment.
 9| And her valleys shall be turned into pitch, and her land into sulphur; and her land shall be as pitch burning night and day; 
10| and it shall never be quenched, and her smoke shall go up: it shall be made desolate throughout her generations, 
11| and for a long time birds and hedgehogs, and ibises and ravens shall dwell in it: and the measuring line of desolation shall be cast over it, and satyrs shall dwell in it. 
12| Her princes shall be no more; for her kings and her great men shall be destroyed. 
13| And thorns shall spring up in their cities, and in her strong holds: and they shall be habitations of monsters, and a court of ostriches. 
14| And devils shall meet with satyrs, and they shall cry one to the other: there shall satyrs rest, having found for themselves <i>a place of</i> rest. 
15| There has the hedgehog made its nest, and the earth has safely preserved its young: there have the deer met, and seen one another’s faces. 
16| They passed by in <i>full</i> number, and not one of them perished: they sought not one another; for the Lord commanded them, and his Spirit gathered them. 
17| And he shall cast lots for them, and his hand has portioned out <i>their</i> pasture, <i>saying</i>, Ye shall inherit <i>the land</i> for ever: they shall rest on it <i>through</i> all generations. 

#35
1| Be glad, thou thirsty desert: let the wilderness exult, and flower as the lily. 
2| And the desert places of Jordan shall blossom and rejoice; the glory of Libanus has been given to it, and the honour of Carmel; and my people shall see the glory of the Lord, and the majesty of God. 
3| Be strong, ye relaxed hands and palsied knees. 
4| Comfort one another, ye fainthearted; be strong, fear not; behold, our God renders judgment, and he will render <i>it</i>; he will come and save us.
 5| Then shall the eyes of the blind be opened, and the ears of the deaf shall hear. 
6| Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the stammerers shall speak plainly; for water has burst forth in the desert, and a channel <i>of water</i> in a thirsty land. 
7| And the dry land shall become pools, and a fountain of water shall <i>be poured</i> into the thirsty land; there shall there be a joy of birds, ready habitations and marshes. 
8| There shall be there a pure way, and it shall be called a holy way; and there shall not pass by there any unclean person, neither shall there be there an unclean way; but the dispersed shall walk on it, and they shall not go astray. 
9| And there shall be no lion there, neither shall any evil beast go up upon it, nor at all be found there; but the redeemed and gathered on the Lord’s behalf, shall walk in it, 
10| and shall return, and come to Sion with joy, and everlasting joy <i>shall be</i> over their head; for on their head <i>shall be</i> praise and exultation, and joy shall take possession of them: sorrow and pain, and groaning have fled away. 

#36
1| Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of the reign of Ezekias, <i>that</i> Sennacherim, king of the Assyrians, came up against the strong cities of Judea, and took them. 
2| And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsaces out of Laches to Jerusalem to king Ezekias with a large force: and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller’s field. 
3| And there went forth to him Heliakim the steward, the <i>son</i> of Chelcias, and Somnas the scribe, and Joach the <i>son</i> of Asaph, the recorder. 
4| And Rabsaces said to them, Say to Ezekias, Thus says the great king, the king of the Assyrians, Why art thou secure? 
5| Is war carried on with counsel and <i>mere</i> words of the lips? and now on whom dost thou trust, that thou rebellest against me? 
6| Behold, thou trustest on this bruised staff of reed, on Egypt: <i>as soon</i> as a man leans upon it, it shall go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharao king of Egypt and all that trust in him. 
7| But if ye say, We trust in the Lord our God; 
8| yet now make an agreement with my lord the king of the Assyrians, and I will give you two thousand horses, if ye shall be able to set riders upon them. 
9| And how can ye <i>then</i> turn to the face of the satraps? They that trust on the Egyptians for horse and rider, are <i>our</i> servants. 
10| And now, Have we come up against this land to fight against it without the Lord? The Lord said to me, Go up against this land, and destroy it.
11| Then Eliakim and Somnas and Joach said to him, Speak to thy servants in the Syrian tongue; for we understand <i>it</i>: and speak not to us in the Jewish tongue: and wherefore speakest thou in the ears of the men on the wall? 
12| And Rabsaces said to them, Has my lord sent me to your lord or to you, to speak these words? <i>has he</i> not <i>sent</i> me to the men that sit on the wall, that they may eat dung, and drink <i>their</i> water together with you? 
13| And Rabsaces stood and cried with a loud voice in the Jewish language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians: 
14| thus says the king, Let not Ezekias deceive you with words: he will not be able to deliver you. 
15| And let not Ezekias say to you, That God will deliver you, and this city will not at all be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians. 
16| Hearken not to Ezekias: thus says the king of the Assyrians, If ye wish to be blessed, come out to me: and ye shall eat every one <i>of</i> his vine and his fig-trees, and ye shall drink water out of your own cisterns: 
17| until I come and take you to a land, like your own land, a land of corn and wine, and bread, and vineyards. 
18| Let not Ezekias deceive you, saying, God will deliver you. Have the gods of the nations delivered each one his own land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians? 
19| Where is the god of Emath, and Arphath? and where is the god of Eppharuaim? have they been able to deliver Samaria out of my hand? 
20| Which is the god of all these nations, that has delivered his land out of my hand, that God should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? 
21| And they were silent, and none answered him a word; because the king had commanded that none should answer. 
22| And Heliakim the <i>son</i> of Chelcias, the steward, and Somnas the military scribe, and Joach the <i>son</i> of Asaph, the recorder, came in to Ezekias, having their garments rent, and they reported to him the words of Rabsaces. 

#37
1| And it came to pass, when king Ezekias heard <i>it, that</i> he rent his clothes, and put on sackcloth, and went up to the house of the Lord. 
2| And he sent Heliakim the steward, and Somnas the scribe, and the elders of the priests clothed with sackcloth, to Esaias the son of Amos, the prophet. And they said to him, Thus says Ezekias, 
3| To-day is a day of affliction, and reproach, and rebuke, and anger: for the pangs are come upon the travailing <i>woman</i>, but she has not strength to bring forth. 
4| May the Lord thy God hear the words of Rabsaces, which the king of the Assyrians has sent, to reproach the living God, even to reproach with the words which the Lord thy God has heard: therefore thou shalt pray to thy Lord for these that are left. 
5| So the servants of king Ezekias came to Esaias. 
6| And Esaias said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master, Thus saith the Lord, Be not thou afraid at the words which thou hast heard, wherewith the ambassadors of the king of the Assyrians have reproached me, 
7| Behold, I <i>will</i> send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a report, and return to his own country, and he shall fall by the sword in his own land.
8| So Rabsaces returned, and found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna: for he had heard that he had departed from Lachis. 
9| And Tharaca king of the Ethiopians went forth to attack him. And when he heard it, he turned aside, and sent messengers to Ezekias, saying, 
10| Thus shall ye say to Ezekias king of Judea, Let not thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying, Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of the Assyrians.
11| Hast thou not heard what the kings of the Assyrians have done, how they have destroyed the whole earth? and shalt thou be delivered? 
12| Have the gods of the nations which my fathers destroyed delivered them, both Gozan, and Charrhan, and Rapheth, which are in the land of Theemath? 
13| Where are the kings of Emath? and where <i>is the king of</i> Arphath? and where <i>is the king</i> of the city of Eppharuaim, <i>and of</i> Anagugana? 
14| And Ezekias received the letter from the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and opened it before the Lord. 
15| And Ezekias prayed to the Lord, saying, 
16| O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubs, thou alone art the God of every kingdom of the world: thou hast made heaven and earth. 
17| Incline thine ear, O Lord, hearken, O Lord; open thine eyes, O Lord, look, O Lord: and behold the words of Sennacherim, which he has sent to reproach the living God. 
18| For of a truth, Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste the whole world, and the countries thereof, 
19| and have cast their idols into the fire: for, they were no gods, but the work of men’s hands, wood and stone; and they have cast them away. 
20| But now, O Lord our God, deliver us from his hands, that every kingdom of the earth may know that thou art God alone.
21| And Esaias the son of Amos was sent to Ezekias, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, the God of Israel, I have heard thy prayer to me concerning Sennacherim king of the Assyrians. 
22| This is the word which God has spoken concerning him; The virgin daughter of Sion has despised thee, and mocked thee; the daughter of Jerusalem has shaken her head at thee. 
23| Whom hast thou reproached and provoked? and against whom hast thou lifted up thy voice? and hast thou not lifted up thine eyes on high against the Holy One of Israel? 
24| For thou hast reproached the Lord by messengers; for thou hast said, With the multitude of chariots have I ascended to the height of mountains, and to the sides of Libanus; and I have cropped the height of his cedars and the beauty of his cypresses; and I entered into the height of the forest region: 
25| and I have made a bridge, and dried up the waters, and every pool of water. 
26| Hast thou not heard of these things which I did of old? I appointed <i>them</i> from ancient times; but now have I manifested <i>my purpose</i> of desolating nations in <i>their</i> strong holds, and them that dwell in strong cities. 
27| I weakened <i>their</i> hands, and they withered; and they became as dry grass on the house-tops, and as grass. 
28| But now I know thy rest, and thy going out, and thy coming in. 
29| And thy wrath wherewith thou hast been enraged, and thy rancour has come up to me; therefore I will put a hook in thy nose, and a bit in thy lips, and will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. 
30| And this shall be a sign to thee, Eat this year what thou hast sown; and the second year that which is left: and the third year sow, and reap, and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. 
31| And they that are left in Judea shall take root downward, and bear fruit upward: 
32| for out of Jerusalem there shall be a remnant, and the saved ones out of mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall perform this. 
33| Therefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians, He shall not enter into this city, nor cast a weapon against it, nor bring a shield against it, nor make a rampart round it. 
34| But by the way by which he came, by it shall he return, and shall not enter into this city: thus saith the Lord. 
35| I will protect this city to save it for my own sake, and for my servant David’s sake. 
36| And the angel of the Lord went forth, and slew out of the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand: and they arose in the morning and found all <i>these</i> bodies dead. 
37| And Sennacherim king of the Assyrians turned and departed, and dwelt in Nineve. 
38| And while he was worshipping Nasarach his country’s god in the house, Adramelech and Sarasar his sons smote him with swords; and they escaped into Armenia: and Asordan his son reigned in his stead. 

#38
1| And it came to pass at that time, <i>that</i> Ezekias was sick even to death. And Esaias the prophet the son of Amos came to him, and said to him, Thus saith the Lord, Give orders concerning thy house: for thou shalt die, and not live. 
2| And Ezekias turned his face to the wall, and prayed to the Lord, saying, 
3| Remember, O Lord, how I have walked before thee in truth, with a true heart, and have done that which was pleasing in thy sight. And Ezekias wept bitterly. 
4| And the word of the Lord came to Esaias, saying, Go, and say to Ezekias, 
5| Thus saith the Lord, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, and seen thy tears: behold, I <i>will</i> add to thy time fifteen years. 
6| And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians: and I will defend this city. 
7| And this <i>shall be</i> a sign to thee from the Lord, that God will do this thing; 
8| behold, I will turn back the shadow of the degrees <i>of the dial</i> by which ten degrees on the house of thy father the sun has gone down—I will turn back the sun the ten degrees; so the sun went back the ten degrees by which the shadow had gone down.
9| THE PRAYER OF EZEKIAS KING OF JUDEA, WHEN HE HAD BEEN SICK, AND WAS RECOVERED FROM HIS SICKNESS.
10| I said in the end of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave: I shall part with the remainder of my years. 
11| I said, I shall no more at all see the salvation of God in the land of the living: I shall no more at all see the salvation of Israel on the earth: I shall no more at all see man. 
12| <i>My life</i> has failed from among my kindred: I have parted with the remainder of my life: it has gone forth and departed from me, as one that having pitched a tent takes it down <i>again</i>: my breath was with me as a weaver’s web, when she that weaves draws nigh to cut off <i>the</i> thread. 
13| In that day I was given up as to a lion until the morning: so has he broken all my bones: for I was so given up from day <i>even</i> to night. 
14| As a swallow, so will I cry, and as a dove, so do I mourn: for mine eyes have failed with looking to the height of heaven to the Lord, who has delivered me, and removed the sorrow of my soul. 
16| <i>Yea</i>, O Lord, for it was told thee concerning this; and thou hast revived my breath; and I am comforted, and live. 
17| For thou hast chosen my soul, that it should not perish: and thou hast cast all <i>my</i> sins behind me. 
18| For they that are in the grave shall not praise thee, neither shall the dead bless thee, neither shall they that are in Hades hope for thy mercy. 
19| The living shall bless thee, as I also <i>do</i>: for from this day shall I beget children, who shall declare thy righteousness, 
20| O God of my salvation; and I will not cease blessing thee with the psaltery all the days of my life before the house of God. 
21| Now Esaias had said to Ezekias; Take a cake of figs, and mash them, and apply them as a plaster, and thou shalt be well. 
22| And Ezekias said, This is a sign to Ezekias, that I shall go up to the house of God. 

#39
1| At that time Marodach Baladan, the son of Baladan, the king of Babylonia, sent letters and ambassadors and gifts to Ezekias: for he had heard that he had been sick <i>even</i> to death, and was recovered. 
2| And Ezekias was glad of their coming, and he shewed them the house of <i>his</i> spices, and of silver, and gold, and myrrh, and incense, and ointment, and all the houses of his treasures, and all that he had in his stores: and there was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion, which Ezekias did not shew. 
3| And Esaias the prophet came to king Ezekias, and said to him, What say these men? and whence came they to thee? and Ezekias said, They are come to me from a land afar off, from Babylon. 
4| And Esaias said, What have they seen in thine house? and Ezekias said, They have seen everything in my house; and there is nothing in my house which they have not seen: yea, also the <i>possessions</i> in my treasuries. 
5| And Esaias said to him, Hear the word of the Lord of hosts: 
6| Behold, the days come, when they shall take all the <i>things that are</i> in thine house, and all that thy fathers have gathered until this day, shall go to Babylon; and they shall not leave anything at all: and God hath said, 
7| that they shall take also of thy children whom thou shalt beget; and they shall make them eunuchs in the house of the king of the Babylonians. 
8| And Ezekias said to Esaias, Good is the word of the Lord, which he hath spoken: let there, I pray, be peace and righteousness in my days. 

#40
1| Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith God. 
2| Speak, ye priests, to the heart of Jerusalem; comfort her, for her humiliation is accomplished, her sin is put away: for she has received of the Lord’s hand double <i>the amount of</i> her sins.
3| The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make straight the paths of our God. 
4| Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low: and all the crooked <i>ways</i> shall become straight, and the rough <i>places</i> plains. 
5| And the glory of the Lord shall appear, and all flesh shall see the salvation of God: for the Lord has spoken <i>it</i>. 
6| The voice of one saying, Cry; and I said, What shall I cry? All flesh is grass, and all the glory of man as the flower of grass: 
7 8| The grass withers, and the flower fades: but the word of our God abides for ever.
9| O thou that bringest glad tidings to Zion, go up on the high mountain; lift up thy voice with strength, thou that bringest glad tidings to Jerusalem; lift it up, fear not; say unto the cities of Juda, Behold your God! 
10| Behold the Lord! The Lord is coming with strength, and <i>his</i> arm is with power: behold, his reward is with him, and <i>his</i> work before him. 
11| He shall tend his flock as a shepherd, and he shall gather the lambs with his arm, and shall soothe them that are with young. 
12| Who has measured the water in his hand, and the heaven with a span, and all the earth in a handful? Who has weighed the mountains in scales, and the forests in a balance? 
13| Who has known the mind of the Lord? and who has been his counsellor, to instruct him? 
14| Or with whom has he taken counsel, and he has instructed him? or who has taught him judgment, or who has taught him the way of understanding; 
15| since all the nations are counted as a drop from a bucket, and as the turning of a balance, <i>and</i> shall be counted as spittle? 
16| And Libanus is not enough to burn, nor all beasts enough for a whole-burnt offering: 
17| and all the nations are as nothing, and counted as nothing.
18| To whom have ye compared the Lord? and with what likeness have ye compared him? 
19| Has not the artificer made an image, or the goldsmith having melted gold, gilt it over, <i>and</i> made it a similitude? 
20| For the artificer chooses out a wood that will not rot, and will wisely enquire how he shall set up his image, and <i>that so</i> that it should not be moved. 
21| Will ye not know? will ye not hear? has it not been told you of old? Have ye not known the foundations of the earth? 
22| <i>It is</i> he that comprehends the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants in it are as grasshoppers; he that set up the heaven as a chamber, and stretched <i>it</i> out as a tent to dwell in: 
23| he that appoints princes to rule as nothing, and has made the earth as nothing. 
24| For they shall not plant, neither shall they sow, neither shall their root be fixed in the ground: he has blown upon them, and they are withered, and a storm shall carry them away like sticks. 
25| Now then to whom have ye compared me, that I may be exalted? saith the Holy One. 
26| Lift up your eyes on high, and see, who has displayed all these things? <i>even</i> he that brings forth his host by number: he shall call them all by name by <i>means of his</i> great glory, and by the power of his might: nothing has escaped thee.
27| For say not thou, O Jacob, and why hast thou spoken, Israel, <i>saying</i>, My way is hid from God, and my God has taken away <i>my</i> judgement, and has departed? 
28| And now, hast thou not known? hast thou not heard? the eternal God, the God that formed the ends of the earth, shall not hunger, nor be weary, and there is no searching of his understanding. 
29| He gives strength to the hungry, and sorrow to them that are not suffering. 
30| For the young <i>men</i> shall hunger, and the youths shall be weary, and the choice <i>men</i> shall be powerless: 
31| but they that wait on God shall renew <i>their</i> strength; they shall put forth new feathers like eagles; they shall run, and not be weary; they shall walk, and not hunger. 

#41
1| Hold a feast to me, ye islands: for the princes shall renew <i>their</i> strength: let them draw nigh and speak together: then let them declare judgment. 
2| Who raised up righteousness from the east, <i>and</i> called it to his feet, so that it should go? shall appoint <i>it</i> an adversary of Gentiles, and shall dismay kings, and bury their swords in the earth, and cast forth their bows and arrows as sticks? 
3| And he shall pursue them; the way of his feet shall proceed in peace. 
4| Who has wrought and done these things? he has called it who called it from the generations of old; I God, the first and to <i>all</i> futurity, I AM. 
5| The nations saw, and feared; the ends of the earth drew nigh, and came together, 
6| every one judging for his neighbor and <i>that</i> to assist his brother: and one will say, 
7| The artificer has become strong, and the coppersmith that smites with the hammer, <i>and</i> forges also: sometimes he will say, It is a piece well joined: they have fastened them with nails; they will fix them, and they shall not be moved. 
8| But thou, Israel, art my servant Jacob, and he whom I have chosen, the seed of Abraam, whom I have loved: 
9| whom I have taken hold of from the ends of the earth, and from the high places of it I have called thee, and said to thee, Thou art my servant; I have chosen thee, and I have not forsaken thee. 
10| Fear not; for I am with thee: wander not; for I am thy God, who have strengthened thee; and I have helped thee, and have established thee with my just right hand. 
11| Behold, all thine adversaries shall be ashamed and confounded; for they shall be as if they were not: and all thine opponents shall perish. 
12| Thou shalt seek them, and thou shalt not find the men who shall insolently rage against thee: for they shall be as if they were not, and they that war against thee shall not be. 
13| For I am thy God, who holdeth thy right hand, who saith to thee, 
14| Fear not, Jacob, <i>and thou</i> Israel few in number; I have helped thee, saith thy God, he that redeems thee, O Israel. 
15| Behold, I have made thee as new saw-shaped threshing wheels of a waggon; and thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat the hills to powder, and make <i>them</i> as chaff: 
16| and thou shalt winnow <i>them</i>, and the wind shall carry them away, and a tempest shall scatter them: but thou shalt rejoice in the holy ones of Israel. 
17| And the poor and the needy shall exult; for <i>when</i> they shall seek water, and there shall be none, <i>and</i> their tongue is parched with thirst, I the Lord God, I the God of Israel will hear, and will not forsake them: 
18| but I will open rivers on the mountains, and fountains in the midst of plains: I will make the desert pools of water, and a thirsty land watercourses. 
19| I will plant in the dry land the cedar and box, the myrtle and cypress, and white poplar: 
20| that they may see, and know, and perceive, and understand together, that the hand of the Lord has wrought these <i>works</i>, and the Holy One of Israel has displayed <i>them</i>.
21| Your judgment draws nigh, saith the Lord God; your counsels have drawn nigh, saith the King of Jacob. 
22| Let them draw nigh, and declare to you what things shall come to pass; or tell <i>us</i> what things were of old, and we will apply <i>our</i> understanding, and we shall know what are the last and the future things: 
23| tell us, declare ye to us the things that are coming on at the last <i>time</i>, and we shall know that ye are gods: do good, and do evil, and we shall wonder, and see at the same time 
24| whence ye are, and whence is your works: they have chosen you an abomination out of the earth. 
25| But I have raised up him that <i>comes</i> from the north, and him that <i>comes</i> from the rising of the sun: they shall be called by my name: let the princes come, and as potter’s clay, and as a potter treading clay, so shall ye be trodden down. 
26| For who will declare the things from the beginning, that we may know also the former things, and we will say that they are true? there is no one that speaks beforehand, nor anyone that hears your words. 
27| I will give dominion to Sion, and will comfort Jerusalem by the way. 
28| For from among the nations, behold, <i>there was</i> no one; and of their idols there was none to declare <i>anything</i>: and if I should ask them, Whence are ye? they could not answer me. 
29| For <i>these</i> are your makers, <i>as ye think</i>, and they that cause you to err in vain. 

#42
1| Jacob is my servant, I will help him: Israel is my chosen, my soul has accepted him; I have put my Spirit upon him; he shall bring forth judgment to the Gentiles. 
2| He shall not cry, nor lift up <i>his voice</i>, nor shall his voice be heard without. 
3| A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he not quench; but he shall bring forth judgment to truth. 
4| He shall shine out, and shall not be discouraged, until he have set judgment on the earth: and in his name shall the Gentiles trust.
5| Thus saith the Lord God, who made the heaven, and established it; who settled the earth, and the things in it, and gives breath to the people on it, and spirit to them that tread on it: 
6| I the Lord God have called thee in righteousness, and will hold thine hand, and will strengthen thee: and I have given thee for the covenant of a race, for a light of the Gentiles: 
7| to open the eyes of the blind, to bring the bound and them that sit in darkness out of bonds and the prison-house. 
8| I am the Lord God: that is my name: I will not give my glory to another, nor my praises to graven images. 
9| Behold, the ancient things have come to pass, and <i>so will</i> the new things which I tell you: yea, before I tell <i>them</i> they are made known to you. 
10| Sing a new hymn to the Lord: ye <i>who are</i> his dominion, glorify his name from the end of the earth: ye that go down to the sea, and sail upon it; the islands, and they that dwell in them. 
11| Rejoice, thou wilderness, and the villages thereof, the hamlets, and the dwellers in Kedar: the inhabitants of the rock shall rejoice, they shall shout from the top of the mountains. 
12| They shall give glory to God, <i>and</i> shall proclaim his praises in the islands.
13| The Lord God of hosts shall go forth, and crush the war: he shall stir up jealousy, and shall shout mightily against his enemies. 
14| I have been silent: shall I also always be silent and forbear: I have endured like a travailing <i>woman</i>: I will <i>now</i> amaze and wither at once. 
15| I will make desolate mountains and hills, and will dry up all their grass; and I will make the rivers islands, and dry up the pools. 
16| And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, and I will cause them to tread paths which they have not known: I will turn darkness into light for them, and crooked things into straight. These things will I do, and will not forsake them. 
17| But they are turned back: be ye utterly ashamed that trust in graven <i>images</i>, who say to the molten <i>images</i>, Ye are our gods.
18| Hear, ye deaf, and look up, ye blind, to see. 
19| And who is blind, but my servants? and deaf, but they that rule over them? yea, the servants of God have been made blind. 
20| Ye have often seen, and have not taken heed; <i>your</i> ears have been opened, and ye have not heard. 
21| The Lord God has taken counsel that he might be justified, and might magnify <i>his</i> praise. 
22| And I beheld, and the people were spoiled and plundered: for <i>there is</i> a snare in the secret chambers everywhere, and in the houses also, where they have hidden them: they became a spoil, and there was no one that delivered the prey, and there was none who said, Restore. 
23| Who <i>is there</i> among you that will give ear to these things? hearken ye to the things which are coming to pass. 
24| For what did he give to Jacob up to spoil, and Israel to them that plundered him? Did not God <i>do it</i> against whom they sinned? <i>and</i> they would not walk in his ways, nor hearken to his law. 
25| So he brought upon them the fury of his wrath; and the war, and those that burnt round about them, prevailed against them; yet no one of them knew <i>it</i>, neither did they lay <i>it</i> to heart. 

#43
1| And now thus saith the Lord God that made thee, O Jacob, and formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed thee, I have called thee <i>by</i> thy name; thou art mine. 
2| And if thou pass through water, I am with thee; and the rivers shall not overflow thee: and if thou go through fire, thou shalt not be burned; the flame shall not burn thee. 
3| For I am the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel, that saves thee: I have made Egypt and Ethiopia thy ransom, and <i>given</i> Soene for thee. 
4| Since thou becamest precious in my sight, thou hast become glorious, and I have loved thee: and I will give men for thee, and princes for thy life. 
5| Fear not; for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the east, and will gather thee from the west. 
6| I will say to the north, Bring; and to the south, Keep not back; bring my sons from the <i>land</i> afar off, and my daughters from the ends of the earth; 
7| <i>even</i> all who are called by my name: for I have prepared him for my glory, and I have formed him, and have made him: 
8| and I have brought forth the blind people; for <i>their</i> eyes are alike blind, and they that have ears are deaf. 
9| All the nations are gathered together, and princes shall be gathered out of them: who will declare these things? or who will declare to you things from the beginning? let them bring forth their witnesses, and be justified; and let them hear, and declare the truth. 
10| Be ye my witnesses, and I <i>too am</i> a witness, saith the Lord God, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know, and believe, and understand that I am <i>he</i>: before me there was no other God, and after me there shall be none. 
11| I am God; and beside me there is no Saviour. 
12| I have declared, and have saved; I have reproached, and there was no strange <i>god</i> among you: ye are my witnesses, and I am the Lord God, 
13| even from the beginning; and there is none that can deliver out of my hands: I will work, and who shall turn it back?
14| Thus saith the Lord God that redeems you, the Holy One of Israel; for your sakes I will send to Babylon, and I will stir up all that flee, and the Chaldeans shall be bound in ships. 
15| I am the Lord God, your Holy One, who have appointed for Israel your king. 
16| Thus saith the Lord, who makes a way in the sea, and a path in the mighty water; 
17| who brought forth chariots and horse, and a mighty multitude: but they have lain down, and shall not rise: they are extinct, as quenched flax. 
18| Remember ye not the former things, and consider not the ancient things. 
19| Behold, I <i>will</i> do new things, which shall presently spring forth, and ye shall know them: and I will make a way in the wilderness, and rivers in the dry land. 
20| the beasts of the field shall bless me, the owls and young ostriches; for I have given water in the wilderness, and rivers in the dry land, to give drink to my chosen race, 
21| my people whom I have preserved to tell forth my praises.
22| I have not now called thee, O Jacob; neither have I made thee weary, O Israel. 
23| Thou hast not brought me the sheep of thy whole-burnt-offering; neither hast thou glorified me with thy sacrifices. I have not caused thee to serve with sacrifices, neither have I wearied thee with frankincense. 
24| Neither hast thou purchased for me victims for silver, neither have I desired the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou didst stand before me in thy sins, and in thine iniquities. 
25| I, <i>even</i> I, am he that blots out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and thy sins; and I will not remember <i>them</i>. 
26| But do thou remember, and let us plead <i>together</i>: do thou first confess thy transgressions, that thou mayest be justified. 
27| Your fathers first, and your princes have transgressed against me. 
28| And the princes have defiled my sanctuaries: so I gave Jacob <i>to enemies</i> to destroy, and Israel to reproach. 

#44
1| But now hear, Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have chosen. 
2| Thus saith the Lord God that made thee, and he that formed thee from the womb; Thou shalt yet be helped: fear not, my servant Jacob; and beloved Israel, whom I have chosen. 
3| For I will give water to the thirsty that walk in a dry land: I will put my Spirit upon thy seed, and my blessings upon thy children: 
4| and they shall spring up as grass between brooks, and as willows on <i>the banks of</i> running water. 
5| One shall say, I am God’s; and another shall call himself by the name of Jacob; and another shall write with his hand, I am God’s, and shall call himself by the name of Israel. 
6| Thus saith God the King of Israel, and the God of hosts that delivered him; I am the first, and I am hereafter: beside me there is no God. 
7| Who is like me? let him stand, and call, and declare, and prepare for me from the time that I made man for ever; and let them tell you the things that are coming before they arrive. 
8| Hide not yourselves, nor go astray: have ye not heard from the beginning, and <i>have not</i> I told you? ye are witnesses if there is a God beside me.
9| But they that framed <i>false gods</i> did not then hearken; and they that graved <i>images</i> are all vain, performing their own desires, which shall not profit them, but they shall be ashamed 
10| that form a god, and all that grave worthless things: 
11| and all by whom they were made are withered: yea, let all the deaf be gathered from <i>among</i> men, and let them stand together; and let them be ashamed and confounded together: 
12| For the artificer sharpens the iron; he fashions <i>the idol</i> with an axe, and fixes it with an awl, and fashions it with the strength of his arm: and he will be hungry and weak, and will drink no water. 
13| The artificer having chosen a piece of wood, marks it out with a rule, and fits it with glue, and makes it as the form of a man, and as the beauty of a man, to set it up in the house. 
14| He cuts wood out of the forest, which the Lord planted, <i>even</i> a pine tree, and the rain made it grow, 
15| that it might be for men to burn: and having taken part of it he warms himself; yea, they burn part of it, and bake loaves thereon; and <i>of</i> the rest they make for themselves gods, and they worship them. 
16| Half thereof he burns in the fire, and with half of it he bakes loaves on the coals; and having roasted flesh on it he eats, and is satisfied, and having warmed himself he says, I am comfortable, for I have warmed myself, and have seen the fire. 
17| And the rest he makes a graven god, and worships, and prays, saying, Deliver me; for thou art my God. 
18| They have no understanding to perceive; for they have been blinded so that they should not see with their eyes, nor perceive with their heart. 
19| And one has not considered in his mind, nor known in his understanding, that he has burnt up half of it in the fire, and baked loaves on the coals thereof and has roasted and eaten flesh, and of the rest of it he has made an abomination, and they worship it. 
20| Know thou that their heart is ashes, and they err, and no one is able to deliver his soul: see, ye will not say, <i>There is a</i> lie in my right hand.
21| Remember these things, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant; I have formed thee <i>to be</i> my servant: and do thou, Israel, not forget me. 
22| For behold, I have blotted out as a cloud thy transgressions, and thy sin as darkness: turn to me, and I will redeem thee. 
23| Rejoice, ye heavens; for God has had mercy upon Israel: sound the trumpet, ye foundations of the earth: ye mountains, shout <i>with</i> joy, ye hills, and all the trees therein: for God has redeemed Jacob, and Israel shall be glorified. 
24| Thus saith the Lord that redeems thee, and who formed thee from the womb, I am the Lord that performs all things: I stretched out the heaven alone, and established the earth. 
25| Who else will frustrate the tokens of those that have divining spirits, and prophecies from the heart of <i>man</i>? turning the wise back, and making their counsel foolishness; 
26| and confirming the word of his servant, and verifying the counsel of his messengers: who says to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Idumea, Ye shall be built, and her desert places shall spring forth. 
27| Who says to the deep, Thou shalt be dried up, and I will dry up the rivers. 
28| Who bids Cyrus be wise, and he shall perform all my will: who says to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built, and I will lay the foundation of my holy house. 

#45
1| Thus saith the Lord God to my anointed Cyrus, whose right hand I have held, that nations might be obedient before him; and I will break through the strength of kings; I will open doors before him, and cities shall not be closed. 
2| I will go before thee, and will level mountains: I will break to pieces brazen doors, and burst iron bars. 
3| And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, I will open to thee hidden, unseen <i>treasures</i>, that thou mayest know that I, the Lord thy God, that call thee by name, am the God of Israel. 
4| For the sake of my servant Jacob, and Israel mine elect, I will call thee by thy name, and accept thee: but thou hast not known me. 
5| For I am the Lord God, and there is no other God beside me; I strengthened thee, and thou hast not known me. 
6| That they that <i>come</i> from the east and they that <i>come</i> from the west may know that there is no God but me. I am the Lord God, and there is none beside. 
7| I am he that prepared light, and formed darkness; who make peace, and create evil; I am the Lord God, that does all these things. 
8| Let the heaven rejoice from above, and let the clouds rain righteousness: let the earth bring forth, and blossom <i>with</i> mercy, and bring forth righteousness likewise: I am the Lord that created thee. 
9| What excellent thing have I prepared as clay of the potter? Will the ploughman plough the earth all day? shall the clay say to the potter, What art thou doing that thou dost not work, nor hast hands? shall the thing formed answer him that formed it? 
10| As though one should say to <i>his</i> father, What wilt thou beget me? and to his mother, What art thou bringing forth?
11| For thus saith the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, who has formed the things that are to come, Enquire of me concerning my sons, and concerning the works of my hands command me. 
12| I have made the earth, and man upon it: I with my hand have established the heaven; I have given commandment to all the stars. 
13| I have raised him up <i>to be</i> a king with righteousness, and all his ways are right: he shall build my city, and shall turn the captivity of my people, not for ransoms, nor for rewards, saith the Lord of hosts. 
14| Thus saith the Lord of hosts, Egypt has laboured <i>for thee</i>; and the merchandise of the Ethiopians, and the Sabeans, men of stature, shall pass over to thee, and shall be thy servants; and they shall follow after thee bound in fetters, and shall pass over to thee, and shall do obeisance to thee, and make supplication to thee: because God is in thee; and there is no God beside thee, <i>O Lord</i>. 
15| For thou art God, yet we knew <i>it</i> not, the God of Israel, the Saviour. 
16| All that are opposed to him shall be ashamed and confounded, and shall walk in shame: ye isles, keep a feast to me. 
17| Israel is saved by the Lord with an everlasting salvation: they shall not be ashamed nor confounded for evermore. 
18| Thus saith the Lord that made the heaven, this God that created the earth, and made it; he marked it out, he made it not in vain, but formed it to be inhabited: I am the Lord, and there is none beside. 
19| I have not spoken in secret, nor in a dark place of the earth: I said not to the seed of Jacob, Seek vanity: I, even I, am the Lord, speaking righteousness, and proclaiming truth.
20| Assemble yourselves and come; take counsel together, ye that escape of the nations: they that set up wood, <i>even</i> their graven image, have no knowledge, nor they who pray to gods that do not save. 
21| If they will declare, let them draw nigh, that they may know together, who has caused these things to be heard from the beginning: then was it told you. I am God, and there is not another beside me; a just <i>God</i> and a Saviour; there is none but me. 
22| Turn ye to me, and ye shall be saved, ye that <i>come</i> from the end of the earth: I am God, and there is none other. 
23| By myself I swear, righteousness shall surely proceed out of my mouth; my words shall not be frustrated; that to me every knee shall bend, and every tongue shall swear by God, 
24| saying, Righteousness and glory shall come to him: and all that remove them from their borders shall be ashamed. 
25| By the Lord shall they be justified, and in God shall all the seed of the children of Israel be glorified. 

#46
1| Bel has fallen, Nabo is broken to pieces, their graven images are gone to the wild beasts and the cattle: ye take them packed up as a burden to the weary, exhausted, hungry, and <i>at the same time</i> helpless man; 
2| who will not be able to save themselves from war, but they themselves are led <i>away</i> captive. 
3| Hear me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of Israel, who are borne <i>by me</i> from the womb, and taught <i>by me</i> from infancy, <i>even</i> to old age: 
4| I am <i>he</i>; and until ye shall have grown old, I am <i>he</i>: I bear you, I have made, and I will relieve, I will take up and save you.
5| To whom have ye compared me? see, consider, ye that go astray. 
6| They that furnish gold out of a purse, and silver by weight, will weigh it in a scale, and they hire a goldsmith and make idols, and bow down, and worship them. 
7| They bear it upon the shoulder, and go; and if they put it upon its place, it remains, it cannot move: and whosoever shall cry to it, it cannot hear; it cannot save him from trouble. 
8| Remember ye these things, and groan: repent, ye that have gone astray, return in your heart; 
9| and remember the former things <i>that were</i> of old: for I am God, and there is none other beside me, 
10| telling beforehand the latter events before they come to pass, and they are accomplished together: and I said, all my counsel shall stand, and I will do all things that I have planned: 
11| calling a bird from the east, and from a land afar off, for the things which I have planned: I have spoken, and brought <i>him</i>; I have created and made <i>him</i>; I have brought him, and prospered his way. 
12| Hearken to me, ye senseless ones, that are far from righteousness: 
13| I have brought near my righteousness, and I will not be slow with the salvation that is from me: I have given salvation in Sion to Israel for glory. 

#47
1| Come down, sit on the ground, O virgin daughter of Babylon: sit on the ground, O daughter of the Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and luxurious. 
2| Take a millstone, grind meal: remove thy veil, uncover thy white hairs, make bare the leg, pass through the rivers. 
3| Thy shame shall be uncovered, thy reproaches shall be brought to light: I will exact of thee due vengeance, I will no longer deliver thee to men. 
4| Thy deliverer is the Lord of hosts, the Holy One of Israel is his name. 
5| Sit thou down pierced with woe, go into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans: thou shalt no more be called the strength of a kingdom. 
6| I have been provoked with my people; thou hast defiled mine inheritance: I gave them into thy hand, but thou didst not extend mercy to them: thou madest the yoke of the aged man very heavy, 
7| and saidst, I shall be a princess for ever: thou didst not perceive these things in thine heart, nor didst thou remember the latter end. 
8| But now hear these words, thou luxurious one, <i>who art</i> the one that sits <i>at ease</i>, that is secure, that says in her heart, I am, and there is not another; I shall not sit a widow, neither shall I know bereavement. 
9| But now these two things shall come upon thee suddenly in one day, the loss of children and widowhood shall come suddenly upon thee, for thy sorcery, for the strength of thine enchantments, 
10| for thy trusting in wickedness: for thou saidst, I am, and there is not another: know thou, the understanding of these things and thy harlotry shall be thy shame; for thou saidst in thy heart, I am, and there is not another. 
11| And destruction shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not be aware; <i>there shall be a</i> pit, and thou shalt fall into it: and grief shall come upon thee, and thou shalt not be able to be clear; and destruction shall come suddenly upon thee, and thou shalt not know. 
12| Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the abundance of thy sorcery, which thou hast learned from thy youth; if thou canst be profited. 
13| Thou art wearied in thy counsels. Let now the astrologers of the heaven stand and deliver thee, let them that see the stars tell thee what is about to come upon thee. 
14| Behold, they all shall be burnt up as sticks in the fire; neither shall they at all deliver their life from the flame. Because thou hast coals of fire, sit thou upon them; 
15| these shall be thy help. Thou hast wearied thyself with traffic from thy youth: every man has wandered to his own home, but thou shalt have no deliverance. 

#48
1| Hear these <i>words</i>, ye house of Jacob, who are called by the name of Israel, and have come forth out of Juda, who swear by the name of the Lord God of Israel, making mention <i>of it, but</i> not with truth, nor with righteousness; 
2| maintaining also the name of the holy city, and staying themselves on the God of Israel: the Lord of hosts is his name. The former things I have already declared; 
3| and they that have proceeded out of my mouth, and it became well known; I wrought suddenly, and <i>the events</i> came to pass. 
4| I know that thou art stubborn, and thy neck is an iron sinew, and thy forehead brazen. 
5| And I told thee of old what <i>should be</i> before it came upon thee; I made it known to thee, lest thou shouldest say, <i>My</i> idols have done <i>it</i> for me; and shouldest say, <i>My</i> graven and molten images have commanded me. 
6| Ye have heard all this, but ye have not known: yet I have made known to thee the new things from henceforth, which are coming to pass, and thou saidst not, 
7| Now they come to pass, and not formerly: and thou heardest not of them in former days: say not thou, Yea, I know them. 
8| Thou hast neither known, nor understood, neither from the beginning have I opened thine ears: for I knew that thou wouldest surely deal treacherously, and wouldest be called a transgressor even from the womb.
9| For mine own sake will I shew thee my wrath, and will bring before thee my glorious acts, that I may not utterly destroy thee. 
10| Behold, I have sold thee, <i>but</i> not for silver; but I have rescued thee from the furnace of affliction. 
11| For mine own sake I will do <i>this</i> for thee, because my name is profaned; and I will not give my glory to another. 
12| Hear me, O Jacob, and Israel whom I call; I am the first, and I endure for ever. 
13| My hand also has founded the earth, and my right hand has fixed the sky: I will call them, and they shall stand together. 
14| And all shall be gathered, and shall hear: who has told them these things? Out of love to thee I have fulfilled thy desire on Babylon, to abolish the seed of the Chaldeans. 
15| I have spoken, I have called, I have brought him, and made his way prosperous.
16| Draw nigh to me, and hear ye these words; I have not spoken in secret from the beginning: when it took place, there was I, and now the Lord, <i>even</i> the Lord, and his Spirit, hath sent me. 
17| Thus saith the Lord that delivered thee, the Holy One of Israel; I am thy God, I have shewn thee how thou shouldest find the way wherein thou shouldest walk. 
18| And if thou hadst hearkened to my commandments, <i>then</i> would thy peace have been like a river, and thy righteousness as a wave of the sea. 
19| Thy seed also would have been as the sand, and the offspring of thy belly as the dust of the ground: neither now shalt thou by any means be utterly destroyed, neither shall thy name perish before me. 
20| Go forth of Babylon, thou that fleest from the Chaldeans: utter aloud a voice of joy, and let this be made known, proclaim it to the end of the earth; say ye, The Lord hath delivered his servant Jacob. 
21| And if they shall thirst, he shall lead them through the desert; he shall bring forth water to them out of the rock: the rock shall be cloven, and the water shall flow forth, and my people shall drink. 
22| There is no joy, saith the Lord, to the ungodly.

1| Hearken to me, ye islands; and attend, ye Gentiles; after a long time it shall come to pass, saith the Lord: from my mother’s womb he has called my name: 
2| and he has made my mouth as a sharp sword, and he has hid me under the shadow of his hand; he has made me as a choice shaft, and he has hid me in his quiver; 
3| and said to me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, and in thee I will be glorified. 
4| Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have given my strength for vanity and for nothing: therefore is my judgment with the Lord, and my labour before my God. 
5| And now, thus saith the Lord that formed me from the womb to be his own servant, to gather Jacob to him and Israel. I shall be gathered and glorified before the Lord, and my God shall be my strength. 
6| And he said to me, <i>It is</i> a great thing for thee to be called my servant, to establish the tribes of Jacob, and to recover the dispersion of Israel: behold, I have given thee for the covenant of a race, for a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldest be for salvation to the end of the earth.
7| Thus saith the Lord that delivered thee, the God of Israel, Sanctify him that despises his life, him that is abhorred by the nations that are the servants of princes: kings shall behold him, and princes shall arise, and shall worship him, for the Lord’s sake: for the Holy One of Israel is faithful, and I have chosen thee. 
8| Thus saith the Lord, In an acceptable time have I heard thee, and in a day of salvation have I succored thee: and I have formed thee, and given thee for a covenant of the nations, to establish the earth, and to cause to inherit the desert heritages: 
9| saying to them that are in bonds, Go forth; and <i>bidding</i> them that are in darkness shew themselves. They shall be fed in all the ways, and in all the paths <i>shall be</i> their pasture. 
10| They shall not hunger, neither shall they thirst; neither shall the heat nor the sun smite them; but he that has mercy on them shall comfort <i>them</i>, and by fountains of waters shall he lead them. 
11| And I will make every mountain a way, and every path a pasture to them. 
12| Behold, these shall come from far: <i>and</i> these from the north and the west, and others from the land of the Persians.
13| Rejoice, ye heavens; and let the earth be glad: let the mountains break forth <i>with</i> joy; for the Lard has had mercy on his people, and has comforted the lowly ones of his people. 
14| But Sion said, The Lord has forsaken me, and, The Lord has forgotten me. 
15| Will a woman forget her child, so as not to have compassion upon the offspring of her womb? but if a woman should even forget these, yet I will not forget thee, saith the Lord. 
16| Behold, I have painted thy walls on my hands, and thou art continually before me. 
17| And thou shalt soon be built by those by whom thou were destroyed, and they that made thee desolate shall go forth of thee.
18| Lift up thine eyes round about, and look on them all; behold, they are gathered together, and are come to thee. <i>As</i> I live, saith the Lord, thou shalt clothe thyself with them all as with an ornament, and put them on as a bride her attire. 
19| For thy desert and marred and ruined <i>places</i> shall now be too narrow by reason of the inhabitants, and they that devoured thee shall be removed far from thee. 
20| For thy sons whom thou hast lost shall say in thine ears, The place <i>is too</i> narrow for me: make room for me that I may dwell. 
21| And thou shalt say in thine heart, Who has begotten me these? whereas I <i>was</i> childless, and a widow; but who has brought up these for me? and I was left alone; but whence came these to me? 
22| Thus saith the Lord, <i>even</i> the Lord, Behold, I lift up mine hand to the nations, and I will lift up my signal to the islands: and they shall bring thy sons in <i>their</i> bosom, and shall bear thy daughters on <i>their</i> shoulders. 
23| And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their princesses thy nurses, they shall bow down to thee on the face of the earth, and shall lick the dust of thy feet; and thou shalt know that I am the Lord, and they that wait on me shall not be ashamed.
24| Will any one take spoils from a giant? and if one should take <i>a man</i> captive unjustly, shall he be delivered? 
25| For thus saith the Lord, If one should take a giant captive, he shall take spoils, and he who takes <i>them</i> from a mighty <i>man</i> shall be delivered: for I will plead thy cause, and I will deliver thy children. 
26| And they that afflicted thee shall eat their own flesh; and they shall drink their own blood as new wine, and shall be drunken: and all flesh shall perceive that I am the Lord that delivers thee, and that upholds the strength of Jacob. 

#50
1| Thus saith the Lord, Of what kind is your mother’s bill of divorcement, by which I put her away? or to which debtor have I sold you? Behold, ye are sold for your sins, and for your iniquities have I put your mother away. 
2| Why did I come, and there was no man? <i>why</i> did I call, and there was none to hearken? Is not my hand strong to redeem? or can I not deliver? behold, by my rebuke I will dry up the sea, and make rivers a wilderness; and their fish shall be dried up because there is no water, and shall die for thirst. 
3| I will clothe the sky with darkness, and will make its covering as sackcloth.
4| The Lord <i>even</i> God gives me the tongue of instruction, to know when it is fit to speak a word: he has appointed for me early, he has given me an ear to hear: 
5| and the instruction of the Lord, even the Lord, opens mine ears, and I do not disobey, nor dispute. 
6| I gave my back to scourges, and my cheeks to blows; and I turned not away my face from the shame of spitting: 
7| but the Lord God became my helper; therefore I was not ashamed, but I set my face as a solid rock; and I know that I shall never be ashamed, 
8| for he that has justified me draws near; who is he that pleads with me? let him stand up against me at the same time: yea, who is he that pleads with me? let him draw nigh to me. 
9| Behold, the Lord, the Lord, will help me; who will hurt me? behold, all ye shall wax old as a garment, and a moth shall devour you.
10| Who is among you that fears the Lord? let him hearken to the voice of his servant: ye that walk in darkness, and have no light, trust in the name of the Lord, and stay upon God. 
11| Behold, ye all kindle a fire, and feed a flame: walk in the light of your fire, and in the flame which ye have kindled. This has happened to you for my sake; ye shall lie down in sorrow. 

#51
1| Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, and seek the Lord: look to the solid rock, which ye have hewn, and to the hole of the pit which ye have dug. 
2| Look to Abraam your father, and to Sarrha that bore you: for he was alone when I called him, and blessed him, and loved him, and multiplied him. 
3| And now I will comfort thee, O Sion: and I have comforted all her desert places; and I will make her desert places as a garden, and her western places as the garden of the Lord; they shall find in her gladness and exultation, thanksgiving and the voice of praise.
4| Hear me, hear me, my people; and ye kings, hearken to me: for a law shall proceed from me, and my judgment <i>shall be</i> for a light of the nations. 
5| My righteousness speedily draws nigh, and my salvation shall go forth as light, and on mine arm shall the Gentiles trust: the isles shall wait for me, and on mine arm shall they trust. 
6| Lift up your eyes to the sky, and look on the earth beneath: for the sky was darkened like smoke, and the earth shall wax old like a garment, and the inhabitants shall die in like manner: but my righteousness shall not fail. 
7| Hear me, ye that know judgment, the people in whose heart is my law: fear not the reproach of men, and be not overcome by their contempt. 
8| For as a garment will be devoured by time, and as wool will be devoured by a moth, <i>so shall they be consumed</i>; but my righteousness shall be for ever, and my salvation for all generations.
9| Awake, awake, O Jerusalem, and put on the strength of thine arm; awake as in the early time, as the ancient generation. 
10| Art thou not it that dried the sea, the water, <i>even</i> the abundance of the deep; that made the depths of the sea a way of passage for the delivered and redeemed? 
11| for by <i>the help of</i> the Lord they shall return, and come to Sion with joy and everlasting exultation, for praise and joy shall come upon their head: pain, and grief, and groaning, have fled away. 
12| I, <i>even</i> I, am he that comforts thee: consider who thou art, that thou wast afraid of mortal man, and of the son of man, who are withered as grass. 
13| And thou hast forgotten God who made thee, who made the sky and founded the earth; and thou wert continually afraid because of the wrath of him that afflicted thee: for <i>whereas</i> he counselled to take thee away, yet now where is the wrath of him that afflicted thee? 
14| For in thy deliverance he shall not halt, nor tarry; 
15| for I am thy God, that troubles the sea, and causes the waves thereof to roar: the Lord of hosts is my name. 
16| I will put my words into thy mouth, and I will shelter thee under the shadow of mine hand, with which I fixed the sky, and founded the earth: and <i>the Lord</i> shall say to Sion, Thou art my people.
17| Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, that hast drunk at the hand of the Lord the cup of his fury: for thou hast drunk out and drained the cup of calamity, the cup of wrath: 
18| and there was none to comfort thee of all the children whom thou borest; and there was none to take hold of thine hand, not even of all the children whom thou has reared. 
19| Wherefore these things are against thee; who shall sympathize with thee in thy grief? downfall, and destruction, famine, and sword: who shall comfort thee? 
20| Thy sons are the perplexed ones, that sleep at the top of every street as a half-boiled beet; they that are full of the anger of the Lord, caused to faint by the Lord God. 
21| Therefore hear, thou afflicted one, and drunken, <i>but</i> not with wine; 
22| thus saith the Lord God that judges his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand the cup of calamity, the cup of my wrath; and thou shalt not drink it any more. 
23| And I will give it into the hands of them that injured thee, and them that afflicted thee; who said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may pass over: and thou didst level thy body with the ground to them passing by without. 

#52
1| Awake, awake, Sion; put on thy strength, O Sion; and o thou put on thy glory, Jerusalem the holy city: there shall no more pass through thee, the uncircumcised and unclean. 
2| Shake off the dust and arise; sit down, Jerusalem: put off the band of thy neck, captive daughter of Sion. 
3| For thus saith the Lord, Ye have been sold for nought; and ye shall not be ransomed with silver. 
4| Thus saith the Lord, My people went down before to Egypt to sojourn there; and were carried away forcibly to the Assyrians. 
5| And now why are ye here? Thus saith the Lord, Because my people was taken for nothing, wonder ye and howl. Thus saith the Lord, On account of you my name is continually blasphemed among the Gentiles. 
6| Therefore shall my people know my name in that day, for I am he that speaks: I am present,
 7| as a season of beauty upon the mountains, as the feet of one preaching glad tidings of peace, as one preaching good news: for I will publish thy salvation, saying, O Sion, thy God shall reign. 
8| For the voice of them that guard thee is exalted, and with the voice together they shall rejoice: for eyes shall look to eyes, when the Lord shall have mercy upon Sion. 
9| Let the waste places of Jerusalem break forth <i>in</i> joy together, because the Lord has had mercy upon her, and has delivered Jerusalem. 
10| And the Lord shall reveal his holy arm in the sight of all the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation that <i>comes</i> from our God. 
11| Depart ye, depart, go out from thence, and touch not the unclean thing; go ye out from the midst of her; separate yourselves, ye that bear the vessels of the Lord. 
12| For ye shall not go forth with tumult, neither go by flight: for the Lord shall go first in advance of you; and the God of Israel shall be he that brings up your rear.
13| Behold, my servant shall understand, and be exalted, and glorified exceedingly. 
14| As many shall be amazed at thee, so shall thy face be without glory from men, and thy glory <i>shall not be honoured</i> by the sons of men. 
15| Thus shall many nations wonder at him; and kings shall keep their mouths shut: for they to whom no report was brought concerning him, shall see; and they who have not heard, shall consider. 

#53
1| O Lord, who has believed our report? and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? 
2| We brought a report as <i>of</i> a child before him; <i>he is</i> as a root in a thirsty land: he has no form nor comeliness; and we saw him, but he had no form nor beauty. 
3| But his form was ignoble, and inferior to that of the children of men; <i>he was</i> a man in suffering, and acquainted with the bearing of sickness, for his face is turned from <i>us</i>: he was dishonoured, and not esteemed.
 4| He bears our sins, and is pained for us: yet we accounted him to be in trouble, and in suffering, and in affliction. 
5| But he was wounded on account of our sins, and was bruised because of our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; <i>and</i> by his bruises we were healed. 
6| All we as sheep have gone astray; every one has gone astray in his way; and the Lord gave him up for our sins. 
7| And he, because of his affliction, opens not his mouth: he was led as a sheep to the slaughter, and as a lamb before the shearer is dumb, so he opens not his mouth. 
8| In <i>his</i> humiliation his judgment was taken away: who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken away from the earth: because of the iniquities of my people he was led to death. 
9| And I will give the wicked for his burial, and the rich for his death; for he practised no iniquity, nor craft with his mouth. 
10| The Lord also is pleased to purge him from his stroke. If ye can give an offering for sin, your soul shall see a long-lived seed: 
11| the Lord also is pleased to take away from the travail of his soul, to shew him light, and to form <i>him</i> with understanding; to justify the just one who serves many well; and he shall bear their sins. 
12| Therefore he shall inherit many, and he shall divide the spoils of the mighty; because his soul was delivered to death: and he was numbered among the transgressors; and he bore the sins of many, and was delivered because of their iniquities. 

#54
1| Rejoice, thou barren that bearest not; break forth and cry, thou that dost not travail: for more are the children of the desolate than of her that has a husband: for the Lord has said, 
2| Enlarge the place of thy tent, and of thy curtains: fix <i>the pins</i>, spare not, lengthen thy cords, and strengthen thy pins; 
3| spread forth <i>thy tent</i> yet to the right and the left: for thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and thou shalt make the desolate cities to be inhabited. 
4| Fear not, because thou has been put to shame, neither be confounded, because thou was reproached: for thou shalt forget thy former shame, and shalt no more at all remember the reproach of thy widowhood. 
5| For <i>it is</i> the Lord that made thee; the Lord of hosts is his name: and he that delivered thee, he is the God of Israel, <i>and</i> shall be called <i>so</i> by the whole earth. 
6| The Lord has not called thee as a deserted and faint-hearted woman, nor as a woman hated from <i>her</i> youth, saith thy God. 
7| For a little while I left thee: but with great mercy will I have compassion upon thee. 
8| In a little wrath I turned away my face from thee; but with everlasting mercy will I have compassion upon thee, saith the Lord that delivers thee. 
9| From the time of the water of Noe this is my <i>purpose</i>: as I sware to him at that time, <i>saying</i> of the earth, I will no more be wroth with thee, neither when thou art threatened, 
10| shall the mountains depart, nor shall thy hills be removed: so neither shall my mercy fail thee, nor shall the covenant of thy peace be at all removed: for the Lord <i>who is</i> gracious to thee has spoken <i>it</i>.
11| Afflicted and outcast thou has not been comforted: behold, I <i>will</i> prepare carbuncle <i>for</i> thy stones, and sapphire for thy foundations; 
12| and I will make thy buttresses jasper, and thy gates crystal, and thy border precious stones. 
13| And <i>I will cause</i> all thy sons <i>to be</i> taught of God, and thy children <i>to be</i> in great peace. 
14| And thou shalt be built in righteousness: abstain from injustice, and thou shalt not fear; and trembling shall not come nigh thee. 
15| Behold, strangers shall come to thee by me, and shall sojourn with thee, and shall run to thee for refuge. 
16| Behold, I have created thee, not as the coppersmith blowing coals, and bringing out a vessel <i>fit</i> for work; but I have created thee, not for ruin, that <i>I</i> should destroy <i>thee</i>. 
17| I will not suffer any weapon formed against thee to prosper; and every voice that shall rise up against thee for judgment, thou shalt vanquish them all; and thine adversaries shall be <i>condemned</i> thereby. There is an inheritance to them that serve the Lord, and ye shall be righteous before me, saith the Lord. 

#55
1| Ye that thirst, go to the water, and all that have no money, go <i>and</i> buy; and eat <i>and drink</i> wine and fat without money or price. 
2| Wherefore do ye value at the price of money, and <i>give</i> your labour for that which will not satisfy? hearken to me, and ye shall eat that which is good, and your soul shall feast itself on good things. 
3| Give heed with your ears, and follow my ways: hearken to me, and your soul shall live in prosperity; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, the sure mercies of David. 
4| Behold I have made him a testimony among the Gentiles, a prince and commander to the Gentiles. 
5| Nations which know thee not, shall call upon thee, and peoples which are not acquainted with thee, shall flee to thee for refuge, for the sake of the Lord thy God, the Holy One of Israel; for he has glorified thee.
6| Seek ye the Lord, and when ye find him, call upon him; and when he shall draw nigh to you, 
7| let the ungodly leave his ways, and the transgressor his counsels: and let him return to the Lord, and he shall find mercy; for he shall abundantly pardon your sins. 
8| For my counsels are not as your counsels, nor are my ways as your ways, saith the Lord. 
9| But as the heaven is distant from the earth, so is my way distant from your ways, and your thoughts from my mind. 
10| For as rain shall come down, or snow, from heaven, and shall not return until it have saturated the earth, and it bring forth, and bud, and give seed to the sower, and bread for food: 
11| so shall my word be, whatever shall proceed out of my mouth, it shall by no means turn back, until all the things which I willed shall have been accomplished; and I will make thy ways prosperous, and <i>will effect</i> my commands. 
12| For ye shall go forth with joy, and shall be taught with gladness: for the mountains and the hills shall exult to welcome you with joy, and all the trees of the field shall applaud with their branches. 
13| And instead of the bramble shall come up the cypress, and instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle: and the Lord shall be for a name, and for an everlasting sign, and shall not fail. 

#56
1| Thus saith the Lord, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my salvation is near to come, and my mercy to be revealed. 
2| Blessed is the man that does these things, and the man that holds by them, and keeps the sabbaths from profaning them, and keeps his hands from doing unrighteousness.
3| Let not the stranger who attaches himself to the Lord, say, Surely the Lord will separate me from his people: and let not the eunuch say, I am a dry tree. 
4| Thus saith the Lord to the eunuchs, as many as shall keep my sabbaths, and choose the things which I take pleasure in, and take hold of my covenant; 
5| I will give to them in my house and within my walls an honourable place, better than sons and daughters: I will give them an everlasting name, and it shall not fail. 
6| And <i>I will give it</i> to the strangers that attach themselves to the Lord, to serve him, and to love the name of the Lord, to be to him servants and handmaids; and <i>as for</i> all that keep my sabbaths from profaning <i>them</i>, and that take hold of my covenant; 
7| I will bring them to my holy mountain, and gladden them in my house of prayer: their whole-burnt-offerings and their sacrifices shall be acceptable upon mine altar; for my house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations, 
8| saith the Lord that gathers the dispersed of Israel; for I will gather to him a congregation.
9| All ye beasts of the field, come, devour, all ye beasts of the forest. 
10| See how they are all blinded: they have not known; <i>they are</i> dumb dogs <i>that</i> will not bark; dreaming of rest, loving to slumber. 
11| Yea, they are insatiable dogs, that know not what it is to be filled, and they are wicked, having no understanding: all have followed their own ways, each according to his <i>will</i>.

#57
1| See how the just man has perished, and no one lays <i>it</i> to heart: and righteous men are taken away, and no one considers: for the righteous has been removed out of the way of injustice. 
2| His burial shall be in peace: he has been removed out of the way.
3| But draw ye near hither, ye lawless children, the seed of adulterers and the harlot. 
4| Wherein have ye been rioting? and against whom have ye opened your mouth, and against whom have ye loosed your tongue? are ye not children of perdition? a lawless seed? 
5| who call upon idols under the leafy trees, slaying your children in the valleys among the rocks? 
6| That is thy portion, this is thy lot: and to them hast thou poured forth drink-offerings, and to these hast thou offered meat-offerings. Shall I not therefore be angry for these things? 
7| On a lofty and high mountain, there is thy bed, and thither thou carriedst up thy meat-offerings: 
8| and behind the posts of thy door thou didst place thy memorials. Didst thou think that if thou shouldest depart from me, thou wouldest gain? thou hast loved those that lay with thee; 
9| and thou hast multiplied thy whoredom with them, and thou hast increased the number of them that are far from thee, and hast sent ambassadors beyond thy borders, and hast been debased even to hell. 
10| Thou has wearied thyself with thy many ways; yet thou saidst not, I will cease to strengthen myself: for thou has done these things; therefore thou has not supplicated me. 
11| Through dread of whom hast thou feared, and lied against me, and has not remembered, nor considered me, nor regarded me, yea, though when I see thee I pass thee by, yet thou has not feared me. 
12| And I will declare thy righteousness, and thy sins, which shall not profit thee. 
13| When thou criest out, let them deliver thee in thine affliction: for all these the wind shall take, and the tempest shall carry <i>them</i> away: but they that cleave to me shall possess the land, and shall inherit my holy mountain. 
14| And they shall say, Clear the ways before him, and take up the stumbling-blocks out of the way of my people. 
15| Thus saith the Most High, who dwells on high for ever, Holy in the holies, is his name, the Most High resting in the holies, and giving patience to the faint-hearted, and giving life to the broken-hearted: 
16| I will not take vengeance on you for ever, neither will I be always angry with you: for my Spirit shall go forth from me, and I have created all breath. 
17| On account of sin for a little while I grieved him, and smote him, and turned away my face from him; and he was grieved, and he went on sorrowful in his ways. 
18| I have seen his ways, and healed him, and comforted him, and given him true comfort; 
19| peace upon peace to them that are far off, and to them that are nigh: and the Lord has said, I will heal them. 
20| But the unrighteous shall be tossed as troubled waves, and shall not be able to rest. 
21| There is no joy to the ungodly, said God. 

#58
1| Cry aloud, and spare not; lift up thy voice as with a trumpet, and declare to my people their sins, and to the house of Jacob their iniquities. 
2| They seek me day by day, and desire to know my ways, as a people that had done righteousness, and had not forsaken the judgment of their God: they now ask of me righteous judgment, and desire to draw nigh to God,
 3| saying, Why have we fasted, and thou regardest not? <i>why</i> have we afflicted our souls, and thou didst not know it? Nay, in the days of your fasts ye find your pleasures, and all them that are under your power ye wound. 
4| If ye fast for quarrels and strifes, and smite the lowly with <i>your</i> fists, wherefore do ye fast to me as <i>ye do</i> this day, so that your voice may be heard in crying? 
5| I have not chosen this fast, nor <i>such</i> a day for a man to afflict his soul; neither though thou shouldest bend down thy neck as a ring, and spread under thee sackcloth and ashes, neither thus shall ye call a fast acceptable. 
6| I have not chosen such a fast, saith the Lord; but do thou loose every burden of iniquity, do thou untie the knots of hard bargains, set the bruised free, and cancel every unjust account. 
7| Break thy bread to the hungry, and lead the unsheltered poor to thy house: if thou seest one naked, clothe <i>him</i>, and thou shalt not disregard the relations of thine own seed.
8| Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thy health shall speedily spring forth: and thy righteousness shall go before thee, and the glory of God shall compass thee. 
9| Then shalt thou cry, and God shall hearken to thee; while thou art yet speaking he will say, Behold, I am here. If thou remove from thee the band, and the stretching forth of the hands, and murmuring speech; 
10| and <i>if</i> thou give bread to the hungry from thy heart, and satisfy the afflicted soul; then shall thy light spring up in darkness, and thy darkness <i>shall be</i> as noon-day: 
11| and thy God shall be with thee continually, and thou shalt be satisfied according as thy soul desires; and thy bones shall be made fat, and shall be as a well-watered garden, and as a fountain <i>from</i> which the water has not failed. 
12| And thy old waste desert <i>places</i> shall be built up, and thy foundations shall last through all generations; and thou shalt be called a repairer of breaches, and thou shalt cause thy paths between to be in peace.
13| If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, so as not to do thy pleasure on the holy days, and shalt call the sabbaths delightful, holy to God; <i>if</i> thou shalt not lift up thy foot to work, nor speak a word in anger out of thy mouth, 
14| then shalt thou trust on the Lord; and he shall bring thee up to the good places of the land, and feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the Lord has spoken this. 

#59
1| Has the hand of the Lord no power to save? or has he made his ear heavy, so that he should not hear? 
2| Nay, your iniquities separate between you and God, and because of your sins has he turned away <i>his</i> face from you, so as not to have mercy <i>upon you</i>. 
3| For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with sins; your lips also have spoken iniquity, and your tongue meditates unrighteousness. 
4| None speaks justly, neither is there true judgment: they trust in vanities, and speak empty <i>words</i>; for they conceive trouble, and bring forth iniquity. 
5| They have hatched asps’ eggs, and weave a spider’s web: and he that is going to eat of their eggs, having crushed an addled egg, has found also in it a basilisk. 
6| Their web shall not become a garment, nor shall they at all clothe themselves with their works; for their works are works of iniquity. 
7| And their feet run to wickedness, swift to shed blood; their thoughts also are thoughts of murder; destruction and misery are in their ways; 
8| and the way of peace they know not, neither is there judgment in their ways; for their paths by which they go are crooked, and they know not peace.
9| Therefore has judgment departed from them, and righteousness shall not overtake them: while they waited for light, darkness came upon them; while they waited for brightness, they walked in perplexity. 
10| They shall feel for the wall as blind <i>men</i>, and shall feel <i>for it</i> as if they had no eyes: and they shall feel at noon-day as at midnight; they shall groan as dying men. 
11| They shall proceed together as a bear and as a dove: we have waited for judgment, and there is no salvation, it is gone far from us. 
12| For our iniquity is great before thee, and our sins have risen up against us: for our iniquities are in us, and we know our unrighteous deeds. 
13| We have sinned, and dealt falsely, and revolted from our God: we have spoken unrighteous words, and have been disobedient; we have conceived and uttered from our heart unrighteous words. 
14| And we have turned judgment back, and righteousness has departed afar off: for truth is consumed in their ways, and they could not pass by a straight <i>path</i>. 
15| And truth has been taken away, and they have turned aside <i>their</i> mind from understanding. And the Lord saw it, and it pleased him not that there was no judgment. 
16| And he looked, and there was no man, and he observed, and there was none to help: so he defended them with his arm, and stablished <i>them</i> with <i>his</i> mercy. 
17| And he put on righteousness as a breast-plate, and placed the helmet of salvation on his head; and he clothed himself with the garment of vengeance, and with his cloak, 
18| as one about to render a recompence, <i>even</i> reproach to his adversaries. 
19| So shall they of the west fear the name of the Lord, and they <i>that come</i> from the rising of the sun his glorious name: for the wrath of the Lord shall come as a mighty river, it shall come with fury. 
20| And the deliverer shall come for Sion’s sake, and shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob. 
21| And this shall be my covenant with them, said the Lord; My Spirit which is upon thee, and the words which I have put in thy mouth, shall never fail from thy mouth, nor from the mouth of thy seed, for the Lord has spoken it, henceforth and for ever.

1| Be enlightened, be enlightened, O Jerusalem, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee. 
2| Behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and <i>there shall be</i> gross darkness on the nations: but the Lord shall appear upon thee, and his glory shall be seen upon thee. 
3| And kings shall walk in thy light, and nations in thy brightness. 
4| Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold thy children gathered: all thy sons have come from far, and thy daughters shall be borne on <i>men’s</i> shoulders. 
5| Then shalt thou see, and fear, and be amazed in thine heart; for the wealth of the sea shall come round to thee, and of nations and peoples; and herds of camels shall come to thee, 
6| and the camels of Madiam and Gaepha shall cover thee: all from Saba shall come bearing gold, and shall bring frankincense, and they shall publish the salvation of the Lord. 
7| And all the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered, and the rams of Nabaeoth shall come; and acceptable sacrifices shall be offered on my altar, and my house of prayer shall be glorified. 
8| Who are these <i>that</i> fly as clouds, and as doves with young ones to me? 
9| The isles have waited for me, and the ships of Tharsis among the first, to bring thy children from afar, and their silver and their gold with them, and <i>that</i> for the sake of the holy name of the Lord, and because the Holy One of Israel is glorified. 
10| And strangers shall build thy walls, and their kings shall wait upon thee: for by reason of my wrath I smote thee, and by reason of mercy I loved thee. 
11| And thy gates shall be opened continually; they shall not be shut day nor night; to bring in to thee the power of the Gentiles, and their kings as captives. 
12| For the nations and the kings which will not serve thee shall perish; and those nations shall be made utterly desolate. 
13| And the glory of Libanus shall come to thee, with the cypress, and pine, and cedar together, to glorify my holy place. 
14| And the sons of them that afflicted thee, and of them that provoked thee, shall come to thee in fear; and thou shalt be called Sion, the city of the Holy One of Israel. 
15| Because thou has become desolate and hated, and there was no helper, therefore I will make thee a perpetual gladness, a joy of many generations. 
16| And thou shalt suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt eat the wealth of kings: and shalt know that I am the Lord that saves thee and delivers thee, the Holy One of Israel. 
17| And for brass I will bring thee gold, and for iron I will bring thee silver, and instead of wood I will bring thee brass, and instead of stones, iron; and I will make thy princes peaceable, and thine overseers righteous. 
18| And injustice shall no more be heard in thy land, nor destruction nor misery in thy coasts; but thy walls shall be called Salvation, and thy gates Sculptured Work. 
19| And thou shalt no more have the sun for a light by day, nor shall the rising of the moon lighten thy night; but the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and God thy glory. 
20| For the sun shall no more set, nor shall the moon be eclipsed; for the Lord shall be thine everlasting light, and the days of thy mourning shall be completed. 
21| Thy people also shall be all righteous; they shall inherit the land for ever, preserving that which they have planted, <i>even</i> the works of their hands, for glory. 
22| The little one shall become thousands, and the least a great nation; I the Lord will gather them in <i>due</i> time.

1| The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me; he has sent me to preach glad tidings to the poor, to heal the broken in heart, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovery of sight to the blind; 
2| to declare the acceptable year of the Lord, and the day of recompence; to comfort all that mourn; 
3| that there should be given to them that mourn in Sion glory instead of ashes, the oil of joy to the mourners, the garment of glory for the spirit of heaviness: and they shall be called generations of righteousness, the planting of the Lord for glory.
4| And they shall build the old waste places, they shall raise up those that were before made desolate, and shall renew the desert cities, <i>even</i> those that had been desolate for <i>many</i> generations. 
5| And strangers shall come and feed thy flocks, and aliens <i>shall be thy</i> ploughmen and vine-dressers. 
6| But ye shall be called priests of the Lord, the ministers of God: ye shall eat the strength of nations, and shall be admired because of their wealth. 
7| Thus shall they inherit the land a second time, and everlasting joy shall be upon their head. 
8| For I am the Lord who love righteousness, and hate robberies of injustice; and I will give their labour to the just, and will make an everlasting covenant with them. 
9| And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their offspring in the midst of peoples: every one that sees them shall take notice of them, that they are a seed blessed of God;
 10| and they shall greatly rejoice in the Lord. Let my soul rejoice in the Lord; for he has clothed me with the robe of salvation, and the garment of joy: he has put a mitre on me as on a bridegroom, and adorned me with ornaments as a bride. 
11| And as the earth putting forth her flowers, and as a garden its seed; so shall the Lord, <i>even</i> the Lord, cause righteousness to spring forth, and exultation before all nations. 

#62
1| For Sion’s sake I will not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem’s sake I will not rest, until her righteousness go forth as light, and my salvation burn as a torch. 
2| And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and kings thy glory: and one shall call thee <i>by</i> a new name, which the Lord shall name. 
3| And thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. 
4| And thou shalt no more be called Forsaken; and thy land shall no more be called Desert: for thou shalt be called My Pleasure, and thy land Inhabited: for the Lord has taken pleasure in thee, and thy land shall be inhabited. 
5| And as a young man lives with a virgin, so shall thy sons dwell in <i>thee</i>: and it shall come to pass <i>that</i> as a bridegroom will rejoice over a bride, so will the Lord rejoice over thee.
6| And on thy walls, O Jerusalem, have I set watchmen all day and all night, who shall never cease making mention of the Lord. 
7| For there is none like you, when he shall have established, and made Jerusalem a praise on the earth. 
8| For the Lord has sworn by his glory, and by the might of his arm, I will no more give thy corn and thy provisions to thine enemies; nor shall strangers any more drink thy wine, for which thou has laboured. 
9| But they that have gathered them shall eat them, and they shall praise the Lord; and they that have gathered <i>the grapes</i> shall drink thereof in my holy courts.
10| Go through my gates, and make a way for my people; and cast the stones out of the way; lift up a standard for the Gentiles. 
11| For behold, the Lord has proclaimed to the end of the earth, say ye to the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy Saviour has come to thee, having his reward and his work before his face. 
12| And one shall call them the holy people, the redeemed of the Lord: and thou shalt be called a city sought out, and not forsaken. 

#63
1| Who is this that is come from Edom, <i>with</i> red garments from Bosor? thus fair in his apparel, with mighty strength? I speak of righteousness and saving judgment. 
2| Wherefore are thy garments red, and thy raiment as <i>if fresh</i> from a trodden winepress? 
3| I am full of trodden <i>grape</i>, and of the nations there is not a man with me; and I trampled them in my fury, and dashed them to pieces as earth, and brought down their blood to the earth. 
4| For the day of recompence has come upon them, and the year of redemption is at hand. 
5| And I looked, and there was no helper; and I observed, and none upheld: therefore my arm delivered them, and mine anger drew nigh. 
6| And I trampled them in mine anger, and brought down their blood to the earth.
7| I remembered the mercy of the Lord, the praises of the Lord in all things wherein he recompenses us. The Lord is a good judge to the house of Israel; he deals with us according to his mercy, and according to the abundance of his righteousness. 
8| And he said, Is it not my people? the children surely will not be rebellious: and he became to them deliverance 
9| out of all their affliction: not an ambassador, nor a messenger, but himself saved them, because he loved them and spared them: he himself redeemed them, and took them up, and lifted them up all the days of old. 
10| But they disobeyed, and provoked his Holy Spirit: so he turned to be an enemy, he himself contended against them. 
11| Then he remembered the ancient days, <i>saying</i>, Where is he that brought up from the sea the shepherd of the sheep? where is he that put his Holy Spirit in them? 
12| who led Moses with his right hand, the arm of his glory? he forced the water <i>to separate</i> from before him, to make himself an everlasting name. 
13| He led them through the deep, as a horse through the wilderness, and they fainted not, 
14| and as cattle through a plain: the Spirit came down from the Lord, and guided them: thus thou leddest thy people, to make thyself a glorious name.
15| Turn from heaven, and look from thy holy habitation and <i>from</i> thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength? where is the abundance of thy mercy and of thy compassions, that thou hast withholden thyself from us? 
16| For thou art our Father; for <i>though</i> Abraham knew us not, and Israel did not acknowledge us, yet do thou, O Lord, our Father, deliver us: thy name has been upon us from the beginning. 
17| Why hast thou caused us to err, O Lord, from thy way? <i>and</i> has hardened our hearts, that we should not fear thee? Return for thy servants’ sake, for the sake of the tribes of thine inheritance, 
18| that we may inherit a small part of thy holy mountain. 
19| We are become as at the beginning, when thou didst not rule over us, and thy name was not called upon us. 

#64
1| If thou wouldest open the heaven, trembling will take hold upon the mountains from thee, and they shall melt, 
2| as wax melts before the fire; and fire shall burn up the enemies, and thy name shall be manifest among the adversaries: at thy presence the nations shall be troubled, 
3| whenever thou shalt work gloriously; trembling from thee shall take hold upon the mountains. 
4| From of old we have not heard, neither have our eyes seen a God beside thee, and thy works which thou wilt perform to them that wait for mercy. 
5| For <i>these blessings</i> shall happen to them that work righteousness, and they shall remember thy ways: behold, thou wast angry and we have sinned; therefore we have erred, 
6| and we are all become as unclean, and all our righteousness as a filthy rag: and we have fallen as leaves because of our iniquities; thus the wind shall carry us <i>away</i>. 
7| And there is none that calls upon thy name, or that remembers to take hold on thee: for thou hast turned thy face away from us, and hast delivered us up because of our sins. 
8| And now, O Lord, thou art our Father, and we are clay, all <i>of us</i> the work of thine hands. 
9| Be not very wroth with us, and remember not our sins for ever; but now look on <i>us</i>, for we are all thy people. 
10| The city of thy holiness has become desolate, Sion has become as a wilderness, Jerusalem a curse. 
11| The house, our sanctuary, and the glory which our fathers blessed, has been burnt with fire: and all our glorious things have gone to ruin. 
12| And for all these things thou, O Lord, has withholden, thyself, and been silent, and hast brought us very low. 

#65
1| I became manifest to them that asked not for me; I was found of them that sought me not: I said, Behold, I am <i>here</i>, to a nation, who called not on my name. 
2| I have stretched forth my hands all day to a disobedient and gainsaying people, to them that walked in a way that was not good, but after their sins. 
3| This is the people that provokes me continually in my presence; they offer sacrifices in gardens, and burn incense on bricks to devils, which exist not. 
4| They lie down to sleep in the tombs and in the caves for the sake of dreams, <i>even</i> they that eat swine’s flesh, and the broth of <i>their</i> sacrifices: all their vessels are defiled: 
5| who say, Depart from me, draw not nigh to me, for I am pure. This is the smoke of my wrath, a fire burns with it continually. 
6| Behold, it is written before me: I will not be silent until I have recompensed into their bosom, 
7| their sins and <i>the sins</i> of their fathers, saith the Lord, who have burnt incense on the mountains, and reproached me on the hills: I will recompense their works into their bosom.
8| Thus saith the Lord, As a grape-stone shall be found in the cluster, and they shall say, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so will I do for the sake of him that serves me, for his sake I will not destroy <i>them</i> all. 
9| And I will lead forth the seed <i>that came</i> of Jacob and of Juda, and they shall inherit my holy mountain: and mine elect and my servants shall inherit it, and shall dwell there. 
10| And there shall be in the forest folds of flocks, and the valley of Achor <i>shall</i> be for a resting-place of herds for my people, who have sought me.
11| But ye are they that have left me, and forget my holy mountain, and prepare a table for the devil, and fill up the drink-offering to Fortune. 
12| I will deliver you up to the sword, ye shall all fall by slaughter: for I called you, and ye hearkened not; I spoke, and ye refused to hear; and ye did evil in my sight, and chose the things wherein I delighted not. 
13| Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, my servants shall eat, but ye shall hunger: behold, my servants shall drink, but ye shall thirst: behold, my servants shall rejoice, but ye shall be ashamed: 
14| behold, my servants shall exult with joy, but ye shall cry for the sorrow of your heart, and shall howl for the vexation of your spirit. 
15| For ye shall leave your name for a loathing to my chosen, and the Lord shall destroy you: but my servants shall be called by a new name, 
16| which shall be blessed on the earth; for they shall bless the true God: and they that swear upon the earth shall swear by the true God; for they shall forget the former affliction, it shall not come into their mind.
17| For there shall be a new heaven and a new earth: and they shall not at all remember the former, neither shall they at all come into their mind. 
18| But they shall find in her joy and exultation; for, behold, I make Jerusalem a rejoicing, and my people a joy. 
19| And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and will be glad in my people: and there shall no more be heard in her the voice of weeping, or the voice of crying. 
20| Neither shall there be there any more a <i>child that dies</i> untimely, or an old man who shall not complete his time: for the youth shall be a hundred years <i>old</i>, and the sinner who dies at a hundred years shall also be accursed: 
21| and they shall build houses, and themselves shall dwell in <i>them</i>; and they shall plant vineyards, and themselves shall eat the fruit thereof. 
22| They shall by no means build, and others inhabit; and they shall by no means plant, and others eat: for as the days of the tree of life shall be the days of my people, they shall long enjoy the fruits of their labours. 
23| My chosen shall not toil in vain, neither shall they beget children to be cursed; for they are a seed blessed of God, and their offspring with them. 
24| And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> before they call, I will hearken to them; while they are yet speaking, I will say, What is it? 
25| Then wolves and lambs shall feed together, and the lion shall eat chaff like the ox, and the serpent earth as bread. They shall not injure nor destroy in my holy mountain, saith the Lord. 

#66
1| Thus saith the Lord, Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: what kind of a house will ye build me? and of what kind <i>is to be</i> the place of my rest? 
2| For all these things are mine, saith the Lord: and to whom will I have respect, but to the humble and meek, and the <i>man</i> that trembles <i>at</i> my words? 
3| But the transgressor that sacrifices a calf to me, is as he that kills a dog; and he that offers fine flour, as <i>one that offers</i> swine’s blood; he that gives frankincense for a memorial, is as a blasphemer. Yet they have chosen their own ways, and their soul has delighted in their abominations. 
4| I also will choose their mockeries, and will recompense their sins upon them; because I called them, and they did not hearken to me; I spoke, and they heard not: and they did evil before me, and chose the things wherein I delighted not.
5| Hear the words of the Lord, ye that tremble at his word; speak ye, our brethren, to them that hate you and abominate you, that the name of the Lord may be glorified, and may appear their joy; but they shall be ashamed. 
6| A voice of a cry from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord rendering recompence to <i>his</i> adversaries. 
7| Before she that travailed brought forth, before the travail-pain came on, she escaped <i>it</i> and brought forth a male. 
8| Who has heard such a thing? and who has seen after this manner? Has the earth travailed in one day? or has even a nation been born at once, that Sion has travailed, and brought forth her children? 
9| But I have raised this expectation, yet thou hast not remembered me, saith the Lord: behold, have not I made the bearing and barren woman? saith thy God. 
10| Rejoice, O Jerusalem, and all ye that love her hold in her a general assembly: rejoice greatly with her, all that <i>now</i> mourn over her: 
11| that ye may suck, and be satisfied with the breast of her consolation; that ye may milk out, and delight yourselves with the influx of her glory. 
12| For thus saith the Lord, Behold, I turn toward them as a river of peace, and as a torrent bringing upon them in a flood the glory of the Gentiles: their children shall be borne upon the shoulders, and comforted on the knees. 
13| As if his mother should comfort one, so will I also comfort you; and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem. 
14| And ye shall see, and your heart shall rejoice, and your bones shall thrive like grass: and the hand of the Lord shall be known to them that fear him, and he shall threaten the disobedient.
15| For, behold, the Lord will come as fire, and his chariots as a storm, to render his vengeance with wrath, and his rebuke with a flame of fire. 
16| For with the fire of the Lord all the earth shall be judged, and all flesh with his sword: many shall be slain by the Lord. 
17| They that sanctify themselves and purify themselves in the gardens, and eat swine’s flesh in the porches, and the abominations, and the mouse, shall be consumed together, saith the Lord. 
18| And I <i>know</i> their works and their imagination. I am going to gather all nations and tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory. 
19| And I will leave a sign upon them, and I will send forth them that have escaped of them to the nations, to Tharsis, and Phud, and Lud, and Mosoch, and to Thobel, and to Greece, and to the isles afar off, to those who have not heard my name, nor seen my glory; and they shall declare my glory among the Gentiles. 
20| And they shall bring your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord with horses, and chariots, in litters <i>drawn by</i> mules with awnings, to the holy city Jerusalem, said the Lord, as though the children of Israel should bring their sacrifices to me with psalms into the house of the Lord. 
21| And I will take of them priests and Levites, saith the Lord. 
22| For as the new heaven and the new earth, which I make, remain before me, saith the Lord, so shall your seed and your name continue. 
23| And it shall come to pass from month to month, and from sabbath to sabbath, <i>that</i> all flesh shall come to worship before me in Jerusalem, saith the Lord. 

24| And they shall go forth, and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not die, and their fire shall not be quenched; and they shall be a spectacle to all flesh.
