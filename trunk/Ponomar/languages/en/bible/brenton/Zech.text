1| In the eighth month, in the second  year of <i>the reign of</i> Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the  son of Barachias, the son of Addo, the prophet, saying,  
2| The Lord has been very angry with your  fathers. 
3| And thou shalt say to  them, Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Turn to me, saith the Lord of hosts, and I  will turn to you, saith the Lord of hosts. 
4|  And be ye not as your fathers, whom the prophets before charged,  saying, Thus saith the Lord Almighty: Turn ye from your evil ways, and from your  evil practices: but they hearkened not, and attended not to hearken to me, saith  the Lord.  
5| Where are your fathers, and the  prophets? Will they live for ever? 
6|  But do ye receive my words and mine ordinances, all that I  command by my Spirit to my servants the prophets, who lived in the days of your  fathers; and they answered and said, As the Lord Almighty determined to do to  us, according to our ways, and according to our practices, so has he done to us.
7| On the twenty-fourth <i>day</i> in the  eleventh month, this is the month Sabat, in the second year of <i>the reign of</i>  Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zacharias, the son of Barachias, the son of  Addo, the prophet, saying,  
8| I saw by night, and behold a man  mounted on a red horse, and he stood between the shady mountains; and behind him  were red horses, and grey, and piebald, and white. 
9| And I said, What are these, <i>my</i> lord? And the angel  spoke with me said to me, I will shew thee what these <i>things</i> are.  
10| And the man that stood between the  mountains answered, and said to me, These are <i>they</i> whom the Lord has sent  forth to go round the earth. 
11| And  they answered the angel of the Lord that stood between the mountains, and said,  We have gone round all the earth, and, behold, all the earth is inhabited, and  is at rest.  
12| Then the angel of the Lord answered  and said, O Lord Almighty, how long wilt thou have no mercy on Jerusalem, and  the cities of Juda, which thou has disregarded these seventy years?  
13| And the Lord Almighty answered the angel  that spoke with me good words and consolatory sayings. 
14| And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry out and  say,  Thus saith the Lord Almighty; I have been jealous for  Jerusalem and Sion with great jealousy. 
15|  And I am very angry with the heathen that combine to attack <i> her</i>: forasmuch as I indeed was a little angry, but they combined to attack <i>her</i> for evil. 
16| Therefore  thus saith the Lord: I will return to Jerusalem with compassion; and my house  shall be rebuilt in her, saith the Lord Almighty, and a measuring line shall yet  be stretched out over Jerusalem. 
17|  And the angel that spoke with me said to me, Cry yet, and say, Thus saith the  Lord Almighty; Yet shall cities be spread abroad through prosperity; and the  Lord shall yet have mercy upon Sion, and shall choose Jerusalem.
18| And I lifted up mine eyes and looked,  and behold four horns. 
19| And I said  to the angel that spoke with me, What are these things, <i>my</i> lord? And he  said to me, These are the horns that have scattered Juda, and Israel, and  Jerusalem. 
20| And the Lord shewed me  four artificers. 
21| And I said, What  are these coming to do? And he said, These are the horns that scattered Juda,  and they broke Israel in pieces, and none of them lifted up his head: and these  are come forth to sharpen them for their hands, <i>even</i> the four horns, the  nations that lifted up the horn against the land of the Lord to scatter it.  Chapter  2

1| And I lifted up mine eyes, and  looked, and behold a man, and in his hand a measuring line.  
2| And I said to him, Whither goest thou?  And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth of it, and  what is the length of it. 
3| And,  behold, the angel that spoke with me stood <i>by</i>, and another angel went  forth to meet him, 
4| and spoke to  him, saying, Run and speak to that young man, saying,  Jerusalem shall be fully inhabited by reason of the abundance  of men and cattle in the midst of her. 
5|  And I will be to her, saith the Lord, a wall of fire round about,  and I will be for a glory in the midst of her.
6| Ho, ho, flee from the land of the  north, saith the Lord: for I will gather you from the four winds of heaven,  saith the Lord, 
7| <i>even</i> to  Sion: deliver yourselves, ye that dwell <i>with</i> the daughter of Babylon. 
8| For thus saith the Lord Almighty;  After the glory has he sent me to the nations that spoiled you: for he that  touches you is as one that touches the apple of his eye. 
9| For, behold, I bring my hand upon them, and they shall be  a spoil to them that serve them: and ye shall know that the Lord Almighty has  sent me.
10| Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of  Sion: for, behold, I come, and will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the Lord. 
11| And many nations shall flee for  refuge to the Lord in that day, and they shall be for a people to him, and they  shall dwell in the midst of thee: and thou shalt know that the Lord Almighty has  sent me to thee. 
12| And the Lord  shall inherit Juda his portion in the holy <i>land</i>, and he will yet choose  Jerusalem. 
13| Let all flesh fear  before the Lord: for he has risen up from his holy clouds.  Chapter  3

1| And the Lord shewed me Jesus the  high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and the Devil stood on his  right hand to resist him. 
2| And the  Lords said to the Devil, 
3|  The Lord rebuke thee, O Devil, even  the Lord that has chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: behold! is not this as a brand  plucked from the fire? 
4|  Now Jesus  was clothed in filthy raiment, and stood before the angel.  
5|  And <i>the Lord</i> answered and spoke to  those who stood before him, saying, Take away the filthy raiment from him: and  he said to him, Behold, I have taken away thine iniquities: and clothe ye him  with a long robe, 
6|  and place a pure  mitre upon his head. So they placed a pure mitre upon his head, and clothed him  with garments: and the angel of the Lord stood <i>by</i>. 
 7|  And the angel of the Lord testified to Jesus, saying, 
8|  Thus saith the Lord Almighty;  If thou wilt walk in my ways, and take heed to my charges,  then shalt thou judge my house: and if thou wilt diligently keep my court, then  will I give thee men to walk in the midst of these that stand <i>here</i>.
  9|  Hear now, Jesus the high priest, thou, and thy  neighbours that are sitting before <i>thee</i>: for they are diviners, for,  behold, I bring forth my servant The Branch. 
10|   For <i>as for</i> the stone which I have set before the face of Jesus, on the  one stone are seven eyes: behold, I am digging a trench, saith the Lord  Almighty, and I will search out all the iniquity of that land in one day.  
11|  In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, ye  shall call together every man his neighbour under the vine and under the  fig-tree.  Chapter  4

1| And the angel that talked with me  returned, and awakened me, as when a man is awakened out of his sleep.   
2| And he said to me, What seest thou?  And I said, I have seen, and behold a candlestick all of gold, and its bowl upon  it, and seven lamps upon it, and seven oil funnels to the lamps upon it:  
3| and two olive-trees above it, one on the  right of the bowl, and one on the left. 
4|  And I inquired, and spoke to the angel that talked with me,  saying, What are these things, <i>my</i> lord? 
5|  And the angel that talked with me answered, and spoke to me,  saying, Knowest thou not what these things are? And I said, No, <i>my</i> lord. 
6| And he answered and spoke to me,  saying, This is the word of the Lord to Zorobabel, saying,  Not by mighty power, nor by strength, but by my Spirit, saith  the Lord Almighty. 
7| Who art thou,  the great mountain before Zorobabel, that thou shouldest prosper? whereas I will  bring out the stone of the inheritance, the grace of it the equal of <i>my</i>  grace.  
8| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying, 
9| The hands of Zorobabel  have laid the foundation of this house, and his hands shall finish it: and thou  shalt know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to thee. 
10| For who has despised the small days? surely they shall  rejoice, and shall see the plummet of tin in the hand of Zorobabel: these are  the seven eyes that look upon all the earth.
11| And I answered, and said to him, What  are these two olive-trees, which are on the right and left hand of the  candlestick? 
12| And I asked the  second time, and said to him, What are the two branches of the olive-trees that  are by the side of the two golden pipes that pour into and communicate with the  golden oil funnels? 
13| And he said  to me, Knowest thou not what these are? and I said, No, <i>my</i> lord.  
14| And he said, These are the two anointed  ones <i>that</i> stand by the Lord of the whole earth.  Chapter  5

1| And I turned, and lifted up mine  eyes, and looked and behold a flying sickle. 
2|  And he said to me, What seest thou? And I said, I see a flying  sickle, of the length of twenty cubits, and of the breadth of ten cubits.  
3| And he said to me,  This is the curse that goes forth over the face of the whole  earth: for every thief shall be punished with death on this side, and every  false swearer shall be punished on that side. 
4|  And I will bring it forth, saith the Lord Almighty, and it shall  enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him that swears falsely  by my name: and it shall rest in the midst of his house, and shall consume it,  and the timber of it, and the stones of it.
5| And the angel that talked with me went  forth, and said to me, Lift up thine eyes, and see this that goes forth.  
6| And I said, What is it? And he said, This  is the measure that goes forth. And he said, This is their iniquity in all the  earth. 
7| And behold a talent of lead  lifted up: and behold a woman sat in the midst of the measure.  
8| And he said, This is iniquity. And he  cast it into the midst of the measure, and cast the weight of lead on the mouth  of it. 
9| And I lifted up mine eyes,  and saw, and, behold, two women coming forth, and the wind was in their wings;  and they had stork’s wings: and they lifted up the measure between the earth and  the sky. 
10| And I said to the angel  that spoke with me, Whither do these carry away the measure?  
11| And he said to me, To build it a house  in the land of Babylon, and to prepare <i>a place for it</i>; and they shall set  it there on its own base.  Chapter  6

1| And I turned, and lifted up mine  eyes, and looked, and, behold, four chariots coming out from between two  mountains; and the mountains were brazen mountains. 
2| In the first chariot <i>were</i> red horses; and in the  second chariot black horses; 
3| and  in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth chariot piebald <i>and</i>  ash-coloured horses. 
4| And I  answered and said to the angel that talked with me, What are these, my Lord?  
5| And the angel that talked with me  answered and said, These are the four winds of heaven, <i>and</i> they are going  forth to stand before the Lord of all the earth. 
6|  <i>As for the chariot</i> in which were the black horses, they  went out to the land of the north; and the white went out after them; and the  piebald went out to the land of the south. 
7|  And the ash-coloured went out, and looked to go and compass the  earth: and he said, Go, and compass the earth. And they compassed the earth.  
8| And he cried out and spoke to me,  saying, Behold, these go out to the land of the north, and they have quieted  mine anger in the land of the north.
9| And the word of the Lord came to me,  saying, 
10| Take the things of the  captivity from the chief men, and from the useful men of it, and from them that  have understood it; and thou shalt enter in that day into the house of Josias  the son of Sophonias that came out of Babylon. 
11|  And thou shalt take silver and gold, and make crowns, and thou  shalt put <i>them</i> upon the head of Jesus the son of Josedec the high priest; 
12| and thou shalt say to him, Thus  saith the Lord Almighty;  Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and he shall spring  up from his stem, and build the house of the Lord. 
13| And he shall receive power, and shall sit and rule upon  his throne; and there shall be a priest on his right hand, and a peaceable  counsel shall be between <i>them</i> both.  
14| And the crown shall be to them that  wait patiently, and to the useful men of the captivity, and to them that have  known it, and for the favour of the son of Sophonias, and for a psalm in the  house of the Lord. 
15| And they <i> that are</i> far from them shall come and build in the house of the Lord, and ye  shall know that the Lord Almighty has sent me to you: and <i>this</i> shall come  to pass, if ye will diligently hearken to the voice of the Lord your God.  Chapter  7

1| And it came to pass in the fourth  year of Darius the king, <i>that</i> the word of the Lord came to Zacharias on  the fourth <i>day</i> of the ninth month, which is Chaseleu.  
2| And Sarasar and Arbeseer the king and his  men sent to Bethel, and <i>that</i> to propitiate the Lord,  
3| speaking to the priests that were in the  house of the Lord Almighty, and to the prophets, saying, The holy offering has  come in hither in the fifth month, as it has done already many years.   
4| And the word of the Lord of hosts came  to me, saying, 
5| Speak to the whole  people of the land, and to the priests, saying, Though ye fasted or lamented in  the fifth or seventh <i>months</i> (yea, behold, these seventy years) have ye at  all fasted to me? 
6| And if ye eat or  drink, do ye not eat and drink for yourselves? 
7|  Are not these the words which the Lord spoke by the former  prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in prosperity, and her cities round  about her, and the hill country and the low country was inhabited?
8| And the word of the Lord came to  Zacharias, saying, 
9| Thus saith the  Lord Almighty;  Judge righteous judgment, and deal mercifully and  compassionately every one with his brother: 
10|  and oppress not the widow, or the fatherless, or the stranger, or  the poor; and let not one of you remember in his heart the injury of his  brother.  
11| But they refused to attend, and madly  turned their back, and made their ears heavy, so that they should not hear. 
12| And they made their heart  disobedient, so as not to hearken to my law, and the words which the Lord  Almighty sent forth by his Spirit by the former prophets: so there was great  wrath from the Lord Almighty. 
13| And  it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> as he spoke, and they hearkened not, so they  shall cry, and I will not hearken, saith the Lord Almighty.  
14| And I will cast them out among all the  nations, whom they know not; and the land behind them shall be made utterly  destitute of any going through or returning: yea they have made the choice land  a desolation.  Chapter  8

1| And the word of the Lord Almighty  came, saying, 
2| Thus saith the Lord  Almighty; I have been jealous for Jerusalem and for Sion with great jealousy,  and I have been jealous for her with great fury.  
3| Thus saith the Lord; I will return to  Sion, and dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a true  city, and the mountain of the Lord Almighty a holy mountain.  
4| Thus saith the Lord Almighty; There  shall yet dwell old men and old women in the streets of Jerusalem, every one  holding his staff in his hand for age. 
5|  And the broad places of the city shall be filled with boys and  girls playing in the streets thereof.  
6| Thus saith the Lord Almighty; If it  shall be impossible in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days,  shall it also be impossible in my sight? saith the Lord Almighty.  
7| Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Behold,  I <i>will</i> save my people from the east country, and the west country;  
8| and I will bring them in, and cause <i> them</i> to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem: and they shall be to me a people,  and I will be to them a God, in truth and in righteousness.
9| Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Let your  hands be strong, <i>ye that</i> hear in these days these words out of the mouth  of the prophets, from the day that the house of the Lord Almighty was founded,  and from the time that the temple was built. 
10|  For before those days the wages of men could not be profitable,  and there could be no hire of cattle, and there could be no peace by reason of  the affliction to him that went out or to him that came in: for I would have let  loose all men, every one against his neighbour. 
11|  But now I <i>will</i> not do to the remnant of this people  according to the former days, saith the Lord Almighty. 
12| But I will shew peace: the vine shall yield her fruit, and  the land shall yield her produce, and the heaven shall give its dew: and I will  give as an inheritance all these things to the remnant of my people.  
13| And it shall come to pass, as ye were a  curse among the nations, O house of Juda, and house of Israel; so will I save  you, and ye shall be a blessing: be of good courage, and strengthen your hands.  
14| For thus saith the Lord Almighty; As  I took counsel to afflict you when your fathers provoked me, saith the Lord  Almighty, and I repented not: 
15| so  have I prepared and taken counsel in these days to do good to Jerusalem and to  the house of Juda: be ye of good courage. 
16|  These <i>are</i> the things which ye shall do; speak truth every  one with his neighbour; judge truth and peaceable judgment in your gates:  
17| and let none of you devise evil in his  heart against his neighbour; and love not a false oath: for all these things I  hate, saith the Lord Almighty.
18| And the word of the Lord Almighty  came to me, saying, 
19| Thus saith  the Lord Almighty, The fourth fast, and the fifth fast, and the seventh fast,  and the tenth fast, shall be to the house of Juda for joy and gladness, and for  good feasts; and ye shall rejoice; and love ye the truth and peace.  
20| Thus saith the Lord Almighty; Yet  shall many peoples come, and the inhabitants of many cities;  
21| and the inhabitants of five cities shall  come together to one city, saying, Let us go to make supplication to the Lord,  and to seek the face of the Lord Almighty; I will go also.  
22| And many peoples and many nations shall  come to seek earnestly the face of the Lord Almighty in Jerusalem, and to obtain  favour of the Lord.  
23| Thus saith the Lord Almighty; In  those days <i>my word shall be fulfilled</i> if ten men of all the languages of  the nations should take hold—even take hold of the hem of a Jew, saying, We will  go with thee; for we have heard that God is with you.  Chapter  9

1| The burden of the word of the Lord,  in the land of Sedrach, and his sacrifice <i>shall be</i> in Damascus; for the  Lord looks upon men, and upon all the tribes of Israel. 
2| And in Emath, <i>even</i> in her coasts, <i>are</i> Tyre  and Sidon, because they were very wise. 
3|  And Tyrus built strong-holds for herself, and heaped up silver as  dust, and gathered gold as the mire of the ways.  
4| And therefore the Lord will take them  for a possession, and will smite her power in the sea; and she shall be consumed  with fire. 
5| Ascalon shall see, and  fear; Gaza also, and shall be greatly pained, and Accaron; for she is ashamed at  her trespass; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ascalon shall not be  inhabited. 
6| And aliens shall dwell  in Azotus, and I will bring down the pride of the Philistines.  
7| And I will take their blood out of their  mouth, and their abominations from between their teeth; and these also shall be  left to our God, and they shall be as a captain of a thousand in Juda, and  Accaron as a Jebusite. 
8| And I will  set up a defence for my house, that they may not pass through, nor turn back,  neither shall there any more come upon them one to drive them away: for now have  I seen with mine eyes.
9| Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Sion;  proclaim <i>it</i> aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem; behold, the King is coming to  thee, just, and a Saviour; he is meek and riding on an ass, and a young foal. 
10| And he shall destroy the chariots  out of Ephraim, and the horse out of Jerusalem, and the bow of war shall be  utterly destroyed; and <i>there shall be</i> abundance and peace out of the  nations; and he shall rule over the waters as far as the sea, and the rivers <i> to</i> the ends of the earth.  
11| And thou by the blood of thy covenant  has sent forth thy prisoners out of the pit that has no water.  
12| Ye shall dwell in strongholds, ye  prisoners of the congregation: and for one day of thy captivity I will  recompense thee double. 
13| For I  have bent thee, O Juda, for myself <i>as</i> a bow, I have filled Ephraim; and I  will raise up thy children, O Sion, against the children of the Greeks, and I  will handle thee as the sword of a warrior. 
14|  And the Lord shall be over them, and <i>his</i> arrow shall go  forth as lightning: and the Lord Almighty shall blow with the trumpet; and shall  proceed with the tumult of his threatening. 
15|  The Lord Almighty shall protect them, and they shall destroy  them, and overwhelm them with sling-stones; and they shall swallow them down as  wine, and fill the bowls as the altar. 
16|  And the Lord their God shall save them in that day, <i>even</i>  his people as a flock; for holy stones are rolled upon his land.  
17| For if he has anything good, and if he  has anything fair, the young <i>men shall have</i> corn, and <i>there shall be</i>  fragrant wine to the virgins.  Chapter  10   

#10
1| Ask ye of the Lord rain in season,  the early and the latter: the Lord has given bright signs, and will give them  abundant rain, to every one grass in the field. 
2|  For the speakers have uttered grievous things, and the diviners <i>have seen</i> false visions, and they have spoken false dreams, they have  given vain comfort: therefore have they fallen away like sheep, and been  afflicted, because there was no healing.  
3| Mine anger was kindled against the  shepherds, and I will visit the lambs; and the Lord God Almighty shall visit his  flock, the house of Juda, and he shall make them as his goodly horse in war. 
4| And from him he looked, and from  him he set <i>the battle in order</i>, and from him <i>came</i> the bow in  anger, <i>and</i> from him shall come forth every oppressor together.  
5| And they shall be as warriors treading  clay in the ways in war; and they shall set the battle in array, because the  Lord is with them, and the riders on horses shall be put to shame.  
6| And I will strengthen the house of  Juda, and save the house of Joseph, and I will settle them; because I have loved  them: and they shall be as <i>if</i> I had not cast them off: for I am the Lord  their God, and I will hear them. 
7|  And they shall be as the warriors of Ephraim, and their heart shall rejoice as  with wine: and their children also shall see <i>it</i>, and be glad; and their  heart shall rejoice in the Lord. 
8| I  will make a sign to them, and gather them in; for I will redeem them, and they  shall be multiplied according to their number before.  
9| And I will sow them among the people;  and they that are afar off shall remember me: they shall nourish their children,  and they shall return. 
10| And I will  bring them again from the land of Egypt, and I will gather them in from among  the Assyrians; and I will bring them into the land of Galaad and to Libanus; and  there shall not even one of them be left behind. 
11|  And they shall pass through a narrow sea, they shall smite the  waves in the sea, and all the deep places of the rivers shall be dried up: and  all the pride of the Assyrians shall be taken away, and the sceptre of Egypt  shall be removed. 
12| And I will  strengthen them in the Lord their God; and they shall boast in his name, saith  the Lord.  Chapter  11

1| Open thy doors, O Libanus, and let  the fire devour thy cedars. 
2| Let  the pine howl, because the cedar has fallen; for the mighty men have been  greatly afflicted: howl, ye oaks of the land of Basan; for the thickly planted  forest has been torn down.  
3| <i>There is</i> a voice of the  shepherds mourning; for their greatness is brought low: a voice of roaring  lions; for the pride of Jordan is brought down.
4| Thus saith the Lord Almighty, Feed the  sheep of the slaughter; 
5| which  their possessors have slain, and have not repented: and they that sold them  said, Blessed be the Lord; for we have become rich: and their shepherds have  suffered no sorrow for them. 
6|  Therefore I will no longer have mercy upon the inhabitants of the land, saith  the Lord: but, behold, I will deliver up the men every one into the hand of his  neighbour, and into the hand of his king; and they shall destroy the land, and I  will not rescue out of their hand.  
7| And I will tend the flock of slaughter  in the land of Chanaan: and I will take for myself two rods; the one I called  Beauty, and the other I called Line; and I will tend the flock.  
8| And I will cut off three shepherds in one  month; and my soul shall grieve over them, for their souls cried out against me. 
9| And I said, I will not tend you:  that which dies, let it die; and that which falls off, let it fall off; and let  the rest eat every one the flesh of his neighbour.  
10| And I will take my beautiful staff,  and cast it away, that I may break my covenant which I made with all the people. 
11| And it shall be broken in that  day; and the Chananites, the sheep that are kept for me, shall know that it is  the word of the Lord. 
12| And I will  say to them, If it be good in your eyes, give <i>me</i> my price, or refuse it.  And they weighed for my price thirty pieces of silver. 
13| And the Lord said to me, Drop them into the furnace, and I  will see if it is good <i>metal</i>, as I was proved for their sakes. And I took  the thirty pieces of silver, and cast them into the furnace in the house of the  Lord.  
14| And I cast away <i>my</i> second rod, <i>even</i> Line, that I might break the possession between Juda and Israel. 
15| And the Lord said to me, Take yet  to thee shepherd’s implements belonging to an unskillful shepherd.  
16| For, behold, I <i>will</i> raise up a  shepherd against the land: he shall not visit that which is perishing, and he  shall not seek that which is scattered, and he shall not heal that which is  bruised, nor guide that which is whole: but he shall devour the flesh of the  choice <i>ones</i>, and shall dislocate the joints <i>of their necks</i>.   
17| Alas for the vain shepherds that have  forsaken the sheep! the sword <i>shall be</i> upon the arms of such a one, and  upon his right eye: his arm shall be completely withered, and his right eye  shall be utterly darkened.  Chapter  12

1| The burden of the word of the Lord  for Israel; saith the Lord, that stretches out the sky, and lays the foundation  of the earth, and forms the spirit of man within him. 
2| Behold, I <i>will</i> make Jerusalem as trembling  door-posts to all the nations round about, and in Judea there shall be a siege  against Jerusalem. 
3| And it shall  come to pass in that day <i>that</i> I will make Jerusalem a trodden stone to  all the nations: every one that tramples on it shall utterly mock at <i>it</i>,  and all the nations of the earth shall be gathered together against it.  
4| In that day, saith the Lord Almighty, I  will smite every horse with amazement, and his rider with madness: but I will  open mine eyes upon the house of Juda, and I will smite all the horses of the  nations with blindness.  
5| And the captains of thousands of Juda  shall say in their hearts, We shall find for ourselves the inhabitants of  Jerusalem in the Lord Almighty their God. 
6|  In that day I will make the captains of thousands of Juda as a  firebrand among wood, and as a torch of fire in stubble; and they shall devour  on the right hand and on the left all the nations round about: and Jerusalem  shall dwell again by herself, <i>even</i> in Jerusalem. 
7| And the Lord shall save the tabernacles of Juda as at the  beginning, that the boast of the house of David, and the pride of the  inhabitants of Jerusalem, may not magnify themselves against Juda.  
8| And it shall come to pass in that day, <i> that</i> the Lord shall defend the inhabitants of Jerusalem; and the weak one  among them in that day shall be as David, and the house of David as the house of  God, as the angel of the Lord before them. 
9|  And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> I will seek to  destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. 
10| And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the  inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and compassion: and they shall  look upon me, because they have mocked <i>me</i>, and they shall make  lamentation for him, as for a beloved <i>friend</i>, and they shall grieve  intensely, as for a firstborn <i>son</i>.  
11| In that day the lamentation in  Jerusalem shall be very great, as the mourning for the pomegranate grove cut  down in the plain. 
12| And the land  shall lament in separate families, the family of the house of David by itself,  and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and  their wives by themselves; 
13| the  family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family  of Symeon by itself, and their wives by themselves; 
14| all the families that are left, each family by itself, and  their wives by themselves.  Chapter  13

1| In that day every place shall be  opened to the house of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for removal and  for separation. 
2| And it shall come  to pass in that day, saith the Lord of hosts, <i>that</i> I will utterly destroy  the names of the idols from off the land, and there shall be no longer <i>any</i>  remembrance of them: and I will cut off the false prophets and the evil spirit  from the land. 
3| And it shall come  to pass, if a man will yet prophesy, that his father and his mother which gave  birth to him shall say to him, Thou shalt not live; for thou has spoken lies in  the name of the Lord: and his father and his mother who gave him birth shall  bind him as he is prophesying.  
4| And it shall come to pass in that day, <i>that</i> the prophets shall be ashamed every one of his vision when he  prophesies; and they shall clothe themselves with a garment of hair, because  they have lied. 
5| And <i>one</i>  shall say, I am not a prophet, for I am a tiller of the ground, for a man  brought me up <i>thus</i> from my youth. 
6|  And I will say to him, What are these wounds between thine hands?  and he shall say, <i>Those</i> with which I was wounded in my beloved house.
7| Awake, O sword, against my shepherds,  and against the man <i>who is</i> my citizen, saith the Lord Almighty: smite the  shepherds, and draw out the sheep: and I will bring mine hand upon the little  ones. 
8| And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> in all the land, saith the Lord, two parts thereof shall be cut off  and perish; but the third shall be left therein. 
9|  And I will bring the third <i>part</i> through the fire, and I  will try them as silver is tried, and I will prove them as gold is proved: they  shall call upon my name, and I will hear them, and say, This is my people: and  they shall say, The Lord <i>is</i> my God.  Chapter  14

1| Behold, the days of the Lord come,  and thy spoils shall be divided in thee. 
2|  And I will gather all the Gentiles to Jerusalem to war, and the  city shall be taken, and the houses plundered, and the women ravished; and half  of the city shall go forth into captivity, but the rest of my people shall not  be utterly cut off from the city.  
3| And the Lord shall go forth, and fight  with those Gentiles as when he fought in the day of war. 
4| And his feet shall stand in that day on the mount of  Olives, which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives shall  cleave asunder, half of it toward the east and the west, a very great division;  and half the mountain shall lean to the north, and half of it to the south. 
5| And the valley of my mountains  shall be closed up, and the valley of the mountains shall be joined on to Jasod,  and shall be blocked up as it was blocked up in the days of the earthquake, in  the days of Ozias king of Juda; and the Lord my God shall come, and all the  saints with him. 
6| And it shall come  to pass in that day that there shall be no light, 
7|  and there shall be for one day cold and frost, and that day <i> shall be</i> known to the Lord, and <i>it shall</i> not <i>be</i> day nor night:  but towards evening it shall be light.
8| And in that day living water shall  come forth out of Jerusalem; half of it toward the former sea, and half of it  toward the latter sea: and so shall it be in summer and spring.  
9| And the Lord shall be king over all the  earth: in that day there shall be one Lord, and his name one,  
10| compassing all the earth, and the  wilderness from Gabe unto Remmon south of Jerusalem. And Rama shall remain in  its place. From the gate of Benjamin to the place of the first gate, to the gate  of the corners, and to the tower of Anameel, as far as the king’s winepresses, 
11| they shall dwell in the city; and  there shall be no more any curse, and Jerusalem shall dwell securely.   
12| And this shall be the overthrow with  which the Lord will smite all the nations, as many as have fought against  Jerusalem; their flesh shall consume away while they are standing upon their  feet, and their eyes shall melt out of their holes, and their tongue shall  consume away in their mouth. 
13| And  there shall be in that day a great panic from the Lord upon them; and they shall  lay hold every man of the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall be clasped  with the hand of his neighbour. 
14|  Juda also shall fight in Jerusalem; and <i>God</i> shall gather the strength of  all the nations round about, gold, and silver, and apparel, in great abundance. 
15| And this shall be the overthrow  of the horses, and mules, and camels, and asses, and all the beasts that are in  those camps, according to this overthrow.
16| And it shall come to pass, <i>that</i>  whosoever shall be left of all the nations that came against Jerusalem, shall  even come up every year to worship the king, the Lord Almighty, and to keep the  feast of tabernacles. 
17| And it  shall come to pass, <i>that</i> whosoever of all the families of the earth shall  not come up to Jerusalem to worship the king, the Lord Almighty, even these  shall be added to the others. 
18| And  if the family of Egypt shall not go up, nor come; then upon them shall be the  overthrow with which the Lord shall smite all the nations, whichever of them  shall not come up to keep the feast of tabernacles. 
19| This shall be the sin of Egypt, and the sin of all the  nations, whosoever shall not come up to keep the feast of tabernacles.   
20| In that day there shall be upon the  bridle of every horse Holiness to the Lord Almighty; and the caldrons in the  house of the Lord shall be as bowls before the altar. 

21| And every pot in Jerusalem and in Juda shall be holy to  the Lord Almighty: and all that sacrifice shall come and take of them, and shall  seethe <i>meat</i> in them: and in that day there shall be no more the Chananite  in the house of the Lord Almighty.
