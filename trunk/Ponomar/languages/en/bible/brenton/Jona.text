1| Now the word of the Lord came  to Jonas the son of Amathi, saying, 
2|  Rise, and go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it; for the  cry of its wickedness is come up to me. 
3|  But Jonas rose up to flee to Tharsis from the presence of the  Lord. And he went down to Joppa, and found a ship going to Tharsis: and he paid  his fare, and went up into it, to sail with them to Tharsis from the presence of  the Lord.
4| And the Lord raised up a wind on the  sea; and there was a great storm on the sea, and the ship was in danger of being  broken. 
5| And the sailors were  alarmed, and cried every one to his god, and cast out the wares that were in the  ship into the sea, that it might be lightened of them. But Jonas was gone down  into the hold of the ship, and was asleep, and snored.  
6| And the shipmaster came to him, and  said to him, Why snorest thou? arise, and call upon thy God, that God may save  us, and we perish not. 
7| And each  man said to his neighbour, Come, let us cast lots, and find out for whose sake  this mischief is upon us. So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonas.  
8| And they said to him, Tell us what is  thine occupation, and whence comest thou, and of what country and what people  art thou? 
9| And he said to them, I  am a servant of the Lord; and I worship the Lord God of heaven, who made the  sea, and the dry <i>land</i>. 
10| Then the men feared exceedingly, and said to him, What is this <i>that</i> thou  hast done? for the men knew that he was fleeing from the face of the Lord,  because he had told them. 
11| And  they said to him, What shall we do to thee, that the sea may be calm to us? for  the sea rose, and lifted its wave exceedingly. 
12|  And Jonas said to them, Take me up, and cast me into the sea, and  the sea shall be calm to you: for I know that for my sake this great tempest is  upon you.  
13| And the men tried hard to return to  the land, and were not able: for the sea rose and grew more and more tempestuous  against them. 
14| And they cried to  the Lord, and said, Forbid it, Lord: let us not perish for the sake of this  man’s life, and bring not righteous blood upon us: for thou, Lord, hast done as  thou wouldest. 
15| So they took  Jonas, and cast him out into the sea: and the sea ceased from its raging.  
16| And the men feared the Lord very  greatly, and offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and vowed vows.    Chapter  2

1| Now the Lord had commanded a great  whale to swallow up Jonas: and Jonas was in the belly of the whale three days  and three nights.   
2|  And Jonas prayed to the Lord his God  out of the belly of the whale, 
3|  and  said, I cried in my affliction to the Lord my God, and he hearkened  to me, <i>even</i> to my cry out of the belly of hell: thou heardest my voice. 
4|  Thou didst cast me into the depths  of the heart of the sea, and the floods compassed me: all thy billows and thy  waves have passed upon me. 
5|  And I  said, I am cast out of thy presence: shall I indeed look again toward thy holy  temple? 
6|  Water was poured around me  to the soul: the lowest deep compassed me, my head went down  
7|  to the clefts of the mountains; I went  down into the earth, whose bars are the everlasting barriers: yet, O Lord my  God, let my ruined life be restored.     
8|  When my soul was failing me, I  remembered the Lord; and may my prayer come to thee into thy holy temple.  
9|  They that observe vanities and lies have  forsaken their own mercy. 
10|  But I  will sacrifice to thee with the voice of praise and thanksgiving: all that I  have vowed I will pay to thee, the Lord of <i>my</i> salvation. 
11|  And the whale was commanded by the  Lord, and it cast up Jonas on the dry <i>land</i>.  Chapter  3

1| And the word of the Lord came to  Jonas the second time, saying, 
2| Rise, go to Nineve, the great city, and preach in it according to the former  preaching which I spoke to thee of. 
3|  And Jonas arose, and went to Nineve, as the Lord had spoken. Now  Nineve was an exceeding great city, of about three days’ journey. 
4| And Jonas began to enter into the city  about a day’s journey, and he proclaimed, and said, Yet three days, and Nineve  shall be overthrown. 
5| And the men of Nineve believed God,  and proclaimed a fast, and put on sackcloths, from the greatest of them to the  least of them. 
6| And the word  reached the king of Nineve, and he arose from off his throne, and took off his  raiment from him, and put on sackcloth, and sat on ashes. 
 7| And proclamation was made, and it was commanded in  Nineve by the king an by his great men, saying, Let not men, or cattle, or oxen,  or sheep, taste <i>any thing</i>, nor feed, nor drink water.  
8| So men and cattle were clothed with  sackcloths, and cried earnestly to God; and they turned every one from their  evil way, and from the iniquity that was in their hands, saying, 
9| Who knows if God will repent, and turn  from his fierce anger, and <i>so</i> we shall not perish?  
10| And God saw their works, that they  turned from their evil ways; and God repented of the evil which he had said he  would do to them; and he did <i>it</i> not.  Chapter  4

1| But Jonas was very deeply grieved,  and he was confounded. 
2| And he  prayed to the Lord, and said, O Lord, were not these my words when I was yet in  my land? therefore I made haste to flee to Tharsis; because I knew that thou are  merciful and compassionate, long-suffering, and abundant in kindness, and  repentest of evil. 
3| And now, Lord  God, take my life from me; for <i>it is</i> better for me to die than to live. 
4| And the Lord said to Jonas, Art  thou very much grieved? 
5| And Jonas went out from the city, and  sat over against the city; and he made for himself there a booth, and he sat  under it, until he should perceive what would become of the city.  
6| And the Lord God commanded a gourd, and  it came up over the head of Jonas, to be a shadow over his head, to shade him  from his calamities: and Jonas rejoiced with great joy for the gourd.   
7| And God commanded a worm the next  morning, and it smote the gourd, and it withered away. 
8| And it came to pass at the rising of the sun, that God  commanded a burning east wind; and the sun smote on the head of Jonas, and he  fainted, and despaired of his life, and said, <i>It is</i> better for me to die  than to live. 
9| And God said to  Jonas, Art thou very much grieved for the gourd? And he said, I am very much  grieved, even to death.  
10| And the Lord said, Thou hadst pity on  the gourd, for which thou has not suffered, neither didst thou rear it; which  came up before night, and perished before <i>another</i> night:  

11| and shall not I spare Nineve, the great  city, in which dwell more than twelve myriads of human beings, who do not know  their right hand or their left hand; and <i>also</i> much cattle?  Back top  Next  Presented by The Common Man&#39;s Prospective. Copyright© 1999-2010 Ernest C. Marsh
