1| And the word of the Lord came to  Michaeas the son of Morasthi, in the days of Joatham, and Achaz, and Ezekias,  kings of Juda, concerning what he saw regarding Samaria and Jerusalem.   
2| Hear <i>these</i> words, ye people;  and let the earth give heed, and all that are in it: and the Lord God shall be  among you for a testimony, the Lord out of his holy habitation.  
3| For, behold, the Lord comes forth out of  his place, and will come down, and will go upon the high places of the earth. 
4| And the mountains shall be shaken  under him, and the valleys shall melt like wax before the fire, and as water  rushing down a declivity.  
5| All these <i>calamities are</i> for  the transgression of Jacob, and for the sin of the house of Israel. What is the  transgression of Jacob? <i>is it</i> not Samaria? and what is the sin of the  house of Juda? <i>is it</i> not Jerusalem? 
6|  Therefore I will make Samaria <i>as</i> a store-house of the  fruits of the field, and <i>as</i> a planting of a vineyard: and I will utterly  demolish her stones, and I will expose her foundations. 
7| And they shall cut in pieces all the graven images, and  all that she has hired they shall burn with fire, and I will utterly destroy all  her idols: because she has gathered of the hires of fornication, and of the  hires of fornication has she amassed <i>wealth</i>.
8| Therefore shall she lament and wail,  she shall go barefooted, and <i>being</i> naked she shall make lamentation as <i> that</i> of serpents, and mourning as of the daughters of sirens.  
9| For her plague has become grievous; for  it has come even to Juda; and has reached to the gate of my people, even to  Jerusalem.  
10| Ye that are in Geth, exalt not  yourselves, and ye Enakim, do not rebuild from <i>the ruins of</i> the house in  derision: sprinkle dust <i>in the place of</i> your laughter.  
11| The inhabitant of Sennaar, fairly  inhabiting her cities, came not forth to mourn for the house next to her: she  shall receive of you the stroke of grief.  
12| Who has begun <i>to act</i> for good  to her that dwells in sorrow? for calamities have come down from the Lord upon  the gates of Jerusalem, 
13| <i>even</i>  a sound of chariots and horsemen: the inhabitants of Lachis, she is the leader  of sin to the daughter of Sion: for in thee were found the transgressions of  Israel. 
14| Therefore shall he cause  men to be sent forth as far as the inheritance of Geth, <i>even</i> vain houses;  they are become vanity to the kings of Israel; 
15|  until they bring the heirs, O inhabitant of Lachis: the  inheritance shall reach to Odollam, <i>even</i> the glory of the daughter of  Israel. 
16| Shave thine hair, and  make thyself bald for thy delicate children; increase thy widowhood as an eagle;  for <i>thy people</i> are gone into captivity from thee.  Chapter  2

1| They meditated troubles, and wrought  wickedness on their beds, and they put it in execution with the daylight; for  they have not lifted up their hands to God. 
2|  And they desired fields, and plundered orphans, and oppressed  families, and spoiled a man and his house, even a man and his inheritance.  
3| Therefore thus saith the Lord; Behold,  I devise evils against this family, out of which ye shall not lift up your  necks, neither shall ye walk upright speedily: for the time is evil.  
4| In that day shall a parable be taken  up against you, and a plaintive lamentation shall be uttered, saying, We are  thoroughly miserable: the portion of my people has been measured out with a  line, and there was none to hinder him so as to turn him back; your fields have  been divided. 
5| Therefore thou shalt  have no one to cast a line for the lot. 
6|  Weep not with tears in the assembly of the Lord, neither let <i> any</i> weep for these things; for he shall not remove the reproaches,  
7| who says, The house of Jacob has provoked  the Spirit of the Lord; are not these his practices? Are not the Lord’s words  right with him? and have they not proceeded correctly? 
8| Even beforetime my people withstood <i>him</i> as an enemy  against his peace; they have stripped off his skin to remove hope <i>in</i> the  conflict of war. 
9| The leaders of my  people shall be cast forth from their luxurious houses; they are rejected  because of their evil practices; draw ye near to the everlasting mountains.  
10| Arise thou, and depart; for this is  not thy rest because of uncleanness: ye have been utterly destroyed;  
11| ye have fled, no one pursuing <i>you:  thy</i> spirit has framed falsehood, it has dropped on thee for wine and strong  drink. But it shall come to pass, <i>that</i> out of the dropping of this  people, 
12| Jacob shall be completely  gathered with all <i>his people:</i> I will surely receive the remnant of  Israel; I will cause them to return together, as sheep in trouble, as a flock in  the midst of their fold: they shall rush forth from among men through the breach  made before them: 
13| they have  broken through, and passed the gate, and gone out by it: and their king has gone  out before them, and the Lord shall lead them.  Chapter  3

1| And he shall say, Hear now these  words, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and ye remnant of the house of Israel; is  it not for you to know judgment? 
2|  <i>who</i> hate good, and seek evil; <i>who</i> tear their skins off them, and  their flesh off their bones: 
3| even  as they devoured the flesh of my people, and stripped their skins off them, and  broke their bones, and divided <i>them</i> as flesh for the caldron, and as meat  for the pot, 
4| thus they shall cry  to the Lord, but he shall not hearken to them; and he shall turn away his face  from them at that time, because they have done wickedly in their practices  against themselves.  
5| Thus saith the Lord concerning the  prophets that lead my people astray, that bit with their teeth, and proclaim  peace to them; and <i>when</i> nothing was put into their mouth, they raised up  war against them: 
6| therefore there  shall be night to you instead of a vision, and there shall be to you darkness  instead of prophecy; and the sun shall go down upon the prophets, and the day  shall be dark upon them. 
7| And the  seers of night-visions shall be ashamed, and the prophets shall be laughed to  scorn: and all the people shall speak against them, because there shall be none  to hearken to them. 
8| Surely I will  strengthen myself with the Spirit of the Lord, and of judgment, and of power, to  declare to Jacob his transgressions, and to Israel his sins.  
9| Hear now these words, ye chiefs of the  house of Jacob, and the remnant of the house of Israel, who hate judgment, and  pervert all righteousness; 
10| who  build up Sion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity. 
11| The heads thereof have judged for gifts, and the priests  thereof have answered for hire, and her prophets have divined for silver: and <i> yet</i> they have rested on the Lord, saying, Is not the Lord among us? no evil  shall come upon us. 
12| Therefore on  your account Sion shall be ploughed as a field, and Jerusalem shall be as a  storehouse of fruits, and the mountain of the house as a grove of the forest.  Chapter  4

1| And at the last days the mountain of  the Lord shall be manifest, established on the tops of the mountains, and it  shall be exalted above the hills; and the peoples shall hasten to it.  
2| And many nations shall go, and say, Come,  let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob;  and they shall shew us his way, and we will walk in his paths: for out of Sion  shall go forth a law, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.  
3| And he shall judge among many peoples,  and shall rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into  ploughshares, and their spears into sickles; and nation shall no more lift up  sword against nation, neither shall they learn to war any more.  
4| And every one shall rest under his vine,  and every one under his fig-tree; and there shall be none to alarm <i>them</i>:  for the mouth of the Lord Almighty has spoken these <i>words</i>.  
5| For all <i>other</i> nations shall walk  everyone in his own way, but we will walk in the name of the Lord our God for  ever and ever.  
6| In that day, saith the Lord, I will  gather her that is bruised, and will receive her that is cast out, and those  whom I rejected. 
7| And I will make  her that was bruised a remnant, and her that was rejected a mighty nation: and  the Lord shall reign over them in mount Sion from henceforth, even for ever.
8| And thou, dark tower of the flock,  daughter of Sion, on thee the dominion shall come and enter in, <i>even</i> the  first kingdom from Babylon to the daughter of Jerusalem. 
9| And now, why hast thou known calamities? was there not a  king to thee? or has thy counsel perished that pangs as of a woman in travail  have seized upon thee? 
10| Be in  pain, and strengthen thyself, and draw near, O daughter of Sion, as a woman in  travail: for now thou shalt go forth out of the city, and shalt lodge in the  plain, and shalt reach even to Babylon: thence shall the Lord thy God deliver  thee, and thence shall he redeem thee out of the hand of thine enemies.   
11| And now have many nations gathered  against thee, saying, We will rejoice, and our eyes shall look upon Sion.  
12| But they know not the thought of the  Lord, and have not understood his counsel: for he has gathered them as sheaves  of the floor. 
13| Arise, and thresh  them, O daughter of Sion: for I will make thine horns iron, and I will make  thine hoofs brass: and thou shalt utterly destroy many nations, and shalt  consecrate their abundance to the Lord, and their strength to the Lord of all  the earth.  Chapter  5

1| Now shall the daughter <i>of Sion</i>  be completely hedged in: he has laid siege against us: they shall smite the  tribes of Israel with a rod upon the cheek.  
2| And thou, Bethleem, house of Ephratha,  art few in number to be <i>reckoned</i> among the thousands of Juda; <i>yet</i>  out of thee shall one come forth to me, to be a ruler of Israel; and his goings  forth were from the beginning, <i>even</i> from eternity.  
3| Therefore shall he appoint them <i>to  wait</i> till the time of her that travails: she shall bring forth, and <i>then</i>  the remnant of their brethren shall return to the children of Israel.  
4| And the Lord shall stand, and see, and  feed his flock with power, and they shall dwell in the glory of the name of the  Lord their God: for now shall they be magnified to the ends of the earth.   
5| And she shall have peace when Assur  shall come into your land, and when he shall come up upon your country; and  there shall be raised up against him seven shepherds, and eight attacks of men. 
6| And they shall tend the Assyrian  with a sword, and the land of Nebrod with her trench: and he shall deliver <i> you</i> from the Assyrian, when he shall come upon your land, and when he shall  invade your coasts.
7| And the remnant of Jacob shall be  among the Gentiles in the midst of many peoples, as dew falling from the Lord,  and as lambs on the grass; that none may assemble nor resist among the sons of  men. 
8| And the remnant of Jacob  shall be among the Gentiles in the midst of many nations, as a lion in the  forest among cattle, and as a <i>lion’s</i> whelp among the flocks of sheep,  even as when he goes through, and selects, and carries off <i>his prey</i>, and  there is none to deliver. 
9| Thine  hand shall be lifted up against them that afflict thee, and all thine enemies  shall be utterly destroyed.  
10| And it shall come to pass in that  day, saith the Lord, <i>that</i> I will utterly destroy the horses out of the  midst of thee, and destroy thy chariots; 
11|  and I will utterly destroy the cities of thy land, and demolish  all thy strong-holds: 
12| and I will  utterly destroy thy sorceries out of thine hands; and there shall be no  soothsayers in thee. 
13| And I will  utterly destroy thy graven images, and thy statues out of the midst of thee; and  thou shalt never any more worship the works of thine hands.  
14| And I will cut off the groves out of the  midst of thee, and I will abolish thy cities. 
15|  and I will execute vengeance on the heathen in anger and wrath,  because they hearkened not.  Chapter  6

1| Hear now a word: the Lord God has  said; Arise, plead with the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.   
2| Hear ye, O mountains, the controversy  of the Lord, and <i>ye</i> valleys <i>even</i> the foundations of the earth: for  the Lord <i>has</i> a controversy with his people, and will plead with Israel. 
3| O my people, what have I done to  thee? or wherein have I grieved thee? or wherein have I troubled thee? answer  me. 
4| For I brought tee up out of  the land of Egypt, and redeemed thee out of the house of bondage, and sent  before thee Moses, and Aaron, and Mariam.  
5| O my people, remember now, what  counsel Balac king of Moab took against thee, and what Balaam the son of Beor  answered him, from the reeds to Galgal; that the righteousness of the Lord might  be known.
6| Wherewithal shall I reach the Lord, <i> and</i> lay hold of my God most high? shall I reach him by  whole-burnt-offerings, by calves of a year old? 
7|  Will the Lord accept thousands of rams, or ten thousands of fat  goats? should I give my first-born for ungodliness, the fruit of my body for the  sin of my soul? 
8| Has it <i>not</i>  been told thee, O man, what <i>is</i> good? or what does the Lord require of  thee, but to do justice, and love mercy, and be ready to walk with the Lord thy  God?
9| The Lord’s voice shall be proclaimed  in the city, and he shall save those that fear his name: hear, O tribe; and who  shall order the city? 
10| <i>Is there</i>  not fire, and the house of the wicked heaping up wicked treasures, and <i>that</i>  with the pride of unrighteousness? 
11|  Shall the wicked be justified by the balanced, or deceitful  weights in the bag, 
12| whereby they  have accumulated their ungodly wealth, and they that dwell in the city have  uttered falsehoods, and their tongue has been exalted in their mouth?   
13| Therefore will I begin to smite thee;  I will destroy thee in thy sins. 
14|  Thou shalt eat, and shalt not be satisfied; and there shall be darkness upon  thee; and he shall depart from <i>thee</i>, and thou shalt not escape; and all  that shall escape shall be delivered over to the sword. 
15| Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt press  the olive, but thou shalt not anoint thyself with oil; and <i>shalt make</i>  wine, but ye shall drink no wine: and the ordinances of my people shall be  utterly abolished. 
16| For thou hast  kept the statues of Zambri, and <i>done</i> all the works of the house of  Achaab; and ye have walked in their ways, that I might deliver thee to utter  destruction, and those that inhabit the city to hissing: and ye shall bear the  reproach of nations.  Chapter  7

1| Alas for me! for I am become as one  gathering straw in harvest, and as <i>one gathering</i> grape-gleanings in the  vintage, when there is no cluster for me to eat the first-ripe fruit: alas my  soul! 
2| For the godly is perished  from the earth; and there is none among men that orders <i>his way</i> aright:  they all quarrel even to blood: they grievously afflict every one his neighbour: 
3| they prepare their hands for  mischief, the prince asks <i>a reward</i>, and the judge speaks flattering  words; it is the desire of their soul: 
4|  therefore I will take away their goods as a devouring moth, and  as one who acts by a <i>rigid</i> rule in a day of visitation. Woe, woe, thy  times of vengeance are come; now shall be their lamentations.  
5| Trust not in friends, and confide not in  guides: beware of thy wife, so as not to commit anything to her.  
6| For the son dishonours his father, the  daughter will rise up against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her  mother-in-law: those in his house <i>shall be</i> all a man’s enemies.
7| But I will look to the Lord; I will  wait upon God my Saviour: my God will hearken to me.  
8| Rejoice not against me, mine enemy;  for I have fallen <i>yet</i> shall arise; for though I should sit in darkness,  the Lord shall be a light to me. 
9| I  will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have sinned against him, until  he make good my cause: he also shall maintain my right, and shall bring me out  to the light, <i>and</i> I shall behold his righteousness.  
10| And she that is mine enemy shall see it,  and shall clothe herself with shame, who says, Where <i>is</i> the Lord thy God?  mine eyes shall look upon her: now shall she be for trampling as mire in the  ways.  
11| <i>It is</i> the day of making of  brick; that day shall be thine utter destruction, and that day shall utterly  abolish thine ordinances. 
12| And thy  cities shall be levelled, and parted among the Assyrians; and thy strong cities  shall be parted from Tyre to the river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain  to mountain. 
13| And the land shall  be utterly desolate together with them that inhabit it, because of the fruit of  their doings.
14| Tend thy people with thy rod, the  sheep of thine inheritance, those that inhabit by themselves the thicket in the  midst of Carmel: they shall feed in the land of Basan, and in the land of Galaad,  as in the days of old.  
15| And according to the days of thy  departure out of Egypt shall ye see marvellous <i>things</i>.  
16| The nations shall see and be ashamed;  and at all their might they shall lay their hands upon their mouth, their ears  shall be deafened. 
17| They shall  lick the dust as serpents crawling on the earth, they shall be confounded in  their holes; they shall be amazed at the Lord our God, and will be afraid of  thee.  
18| Who is a God like thee, cancelling  iniquities, and passing over the sins of the remnant of his inheritance? and he  has not kept his anger for a testimony, for he delights in mercy.  
19| He will return and have mercy upon us;  he will sink our iniquities, and they shall be cast into the depth of the sea, <i>even</i> all our sins. 
20| He  shall give blessings truly to Jacob, and mercy to Abraam, as thou swarest to our  fathers, according to the former days.
