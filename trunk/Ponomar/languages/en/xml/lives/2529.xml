<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
Born in the village of Petra (in Morea), he was
tonsured as an ascetic on Mount Athos. He died in peace in the 17th century. In 1815
the relics of Nilus were discovered uncorrupted and sweet smelling. Today part of
them is in the temple constructed on the place of the ascetical efforts of the Venerable
Nilus and the rest in the Athonite Laura.
