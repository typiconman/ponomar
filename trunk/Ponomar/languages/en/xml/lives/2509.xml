Venerable John the Short was tonsured in the Skete desert in Egypt. The name of Venerable John "the Short" (in translation into Russian means undersized) means that he "short in stature". The Venerable John distinguished himself with unusual obedience, meekness and humility. His spiritual director, St. Poemen (see Aug. 27), ordered him to water a dry tree and it yielded fruit, which was why it was called "the tree of obedience". After he became the trainer of others (refer to May 8 and 9), the Venerable John cared much for their salvation. He died in first half of the Fifth Century. He left many wise sayings.
