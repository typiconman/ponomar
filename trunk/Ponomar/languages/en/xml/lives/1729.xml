<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
      The Holy Martyrs Carpus and Papylus (also those with them:
Agathadorus and Agathonica) suffered for Christ in the city of Pergamon,
during the persecution under Emperor Decius, about 251. St. Carpus was the
bishop of Thyatira, and St. Papylus was his deacon. After being tortured in
Thyatira, Sts. Carpus and Papylus were sent, tied to horses, to the city of
Sardis. St. Agathadorus voluntarily was sent with them. Here "the dedicated
one" Agathadorus, courageously endured "wounds and cuts", and died
during severe torture. Sts. Carpus and Papylus were again returned to
Pergamon and there, after a miraculous deliverance from a fiery furnace,
were beheaded by the sword. St. Agathonica, the sister of St. Papylus, also
was beheaded. In the service for this day, we hymn the Holy Martyrs Carpus
and Papylus, and we also commemorate Sts. Agathadorus and Agathonica.

<TROPARION Tone="4" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
Thy martyrs, O Lord, in their suffering received crowns of incorruption from Thee, our God; for having Thy might they deposed the tormentors and destroyed the powerless audacity of the daemons. Through their prayers do Thou save our souls.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="4" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
As a valuable treasury of the Master
And a fountain pouring out streams of healings
You gave your relics to those on the earth.
Thus they are removing the infirmities of various passions
Ceaselessly granting grace to our souls.
Therefore, O Divine Martyrs, with one voice we celebrate your festival
with love.
</KONTAKION>
