&lt;p&gt;This martyr was a veteran soldier, and was impeached by his officers for the Christian faith, before Maximus, governor of the Lower Mœsia, which was afterwards called Bulgaria. Pasicrates and Valention, both of the same regiment, had received the crown of martyrdom a little before. The judge employed caresses, promises, and threats; but Julius professed that to die for Christ, in order to live eternally with him, would be the accomplishment of all his desires. Whereupon he was condemned to lose his head, and led forth to the place of execution. As he went, Hesychius, a Christian soldier, who was also a prisoner, and suffered martyrdom a few days after him, said: "Go with courage, and run to the crown which the Lord hath promised; and remember me, who shall shortly follow you. Commend me to the servants of God, Pasicrates and Valention, who, by confessing the holy name of Jesus, are gone before us." Julius, embracing Hesychius, said, "Dear brother, make haste to come to us; they whom you salute have already heard you." Julius bound his eyes with a handkerchief, and presenting his neck to the executioner, said, "Lord Jesus, for whose name I suffer death, vouchsafe to receive my soul in the number of thy saints "His martyrdom happened on the 27&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; of May, two days after that of St. Pasicrates, about the year 302, in the reign of Dioclesian, at Durontoro, on the Danube, in the second Mœsia.
