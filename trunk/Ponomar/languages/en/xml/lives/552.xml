<SERVICE Type="1"/><LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
       Saints Gurius and Samonas were born in Emesa. Tonsured in the desert, they converted pagans to Christ, and for this they were subjected to torture during the Diocletian persecution, locked up in prison, and finally beheaded (in the year 306). St. Abibus, the deacon from the village of Thella, near Ruscia, suffered for Christ in Edessa during the reign of the Emperor Licinius (in 322). These martyrs are called confessors, "for they are chastisers for the nonperformance of mutual agreements". One maiden, when she married, received from her husband an oath of faithfulness and love at the grave of the martyrs, was wonderfully protected by them from afflictions and offences and who frustrated her husband and saved her from death.
