<NAME Nominative="Holy Martyrs and Confessors Gurius, Samonas, and Abibus"/> 
<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
      Saints Gurius and Samonas were born in Emesa. Tonsured in the desert, they
converted pagans to Christ, and for this they were subjected to torture during the
Diocletian persecution, locked up in prison, and finally beheaded (in the year 306). St.
Abibus, the deacon from the village of Thella, near Ruscia, suffered for Christ in
Edessa during the reign of the Emperor Licinius (in 322). These martyrs are called
confessors, "for they are chastisers for the nonperformance of mutual agreements".
One maiden, when she married, received from her husband an oath of faithfulness and
love at the grave of the martyrs, was wonderfully protected by them from afflictions
and offences and who frustrated her husband and saved her from death.

<TROPARION Tone="5">
O Christ God, Thou hast given us an impregnable rampart/ in the miracles of Thy holy martyrs./ Through their supplications destroy Thou the councils of the heathen/ and strengthen the scepters of kingdoms,// in that Thou art good and lovest mankind.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="2">
Having received grace from on high, O most lauded martyrs,/ ye intercede for those amid temptations;/ wherefore, ye delivered the maiden from a bitter death, O holy ones;// for ye are truly the glory of Edessa and the joy of the world.
