<TROPARION Tone="4">
Once Mary, pregnant with a seedless pregnancy,/ was registered in Bethlehem with the elder Joseph,/ as being of the seed of David./ And while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered,/ but there was no room for them in the inn./ But the cave showed itself to be a beauteous palace for the Queen,// and Christ is born to raise up the image that fell of old!
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="3" Podoben="1">
Today the Virgin cometh to give birth ineffably/ to the preeternal Word in the cave./ Dance, O world! And having heard this,/ with the angels and shepherds glorify// the preeternal God, Who is to appear as a little babe.
</KONTAKION>
