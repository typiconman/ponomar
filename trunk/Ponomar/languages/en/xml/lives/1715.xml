<TROPARION Tone="5" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
The heavenly powers were amazed at the struggles of the Holy Martyrs,
for even in their mortal bodies,
they fell upon the bodiless enemy by the power of the Cross,
invisibly defeating them.
Therefore they are praying to the Lord that He may have mercy on our souls.
