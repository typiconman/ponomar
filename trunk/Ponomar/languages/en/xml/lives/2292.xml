<NAME Nominative="Apostle Philip of the 70, one of the 7 Deacon"/> 
<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
       One of the 70 Apostles, he was one of the seven deacons chosen by the
Apostles and worked together with Archdeacon Stephen. He was born in Caesarea,
Palestine. When persecution was raised against the Church in Jerusalem, Philip
was not frightened by the "lawless fury", departed to Samaria and preached Christ
to them and here converted many to Christ. Among others he baptized Simon
Magus and the nobleman eunuch of Candace the Queen of Ethiopia (Acts 8:5-13,
26-39). As a bishop Saint Philip preached Christ in Tralles, Lydia where he
destroyed many "temples of idols". He died at a very old age. His four virgin
daughters were granted the gift of prophecy (Acts 21:8-9). One of them, Hermione
(see September 4), accepted the martyr's death and is numbered among the saints.
This holy apostle should be distinguished from the Apostle Philip, who is
commemorated on November 14.

O holy Apostle Philip, pray to unto the merciful God, that He may grant remission of transgressions unto our souls.

<KONTAKION Tone="4" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
Today Philip, forechosen from among the apostles, grantest a wealth of healing to the world.
He is the most wondrous fisherman of the nations, a converser with the disciples of Christ. He protectest those who praise Him from all evil. Therefore we cry out unto him: O, Apostle, save us all by thy prayers.
