Ten Holy Martyrs of Crete: Theodulus, Saturninus, Euporus, Gelasius,   Eunician, Zoticus, Pompeius, Agathopus, Basilides, and Evaristus        They suffered for Christ during the persecution of Decius. These Holy martyrs came from different cities on the island of Crete, but with a single determination they confessed themselves Christians and have endured terrible tortures for their faith, after which they were beheaded by the sword. In the church hymns all these holy martyrs are called out by name and are hymned as &quot;the ten called by God, and the ten-rayed lamp&quot; and &quot;unshakeable pillars&quot;. Their relics subsequently were transferred to Rome.

<TROPARION Tone="4">
In their sufferings, O Lord,/ Thy martyrs received imperishable crowns from Thee our God;/ for, possessed of Thy might,/ they set at nought the tormentors and crushed the feeble audacity of the demons.// By their supplications save Thou our souls.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="4" Podoben="1">
A morning-star hath shone forth,/ the honorable contest of the martyrs,/ illumining for us beforehand Him Who is born in the cave,// to Whom the Virgin gave birth without seed.
