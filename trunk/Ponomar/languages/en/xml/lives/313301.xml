&lt;p&gt;Divorced from her spouse for barrenness, she against her will was tonsured in the Nativity of Christ Women’s Monastery and was then sent to the Suzdal Protection Monastery. Ascending from perfection to perfection through grief and struggle with herself, the Venerable Sofia lived a godly life in the monastery for 17 years and died in 1542. From the grave of the Venerable Sofia flowed many miracles and healings for those who came with faith. Her relics are in the Suzdal Monastery in a hidden place. &lt;/p&gt;
