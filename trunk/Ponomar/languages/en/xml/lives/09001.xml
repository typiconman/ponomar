And it came to pass that Mary was enrolled with Joseph the old man, in Bethlehem, since she was
of the seed of David, and was great with the Lamb, without seed. And when the time for delivery
drew near, and they had no place in the village, the cave did appear to the Queen as a delightful
palace. Verily, Christ shall be born, raising the likeness that fell of old.

Today the Virgin cometh to the cave where she will give birth in an ineffable manner to the Word
Who is before all the ages. Rejoice, therefore, O universe, when thou hearest it heralded: Glorify
Him, with the angels and the shepherds, Who chose to be seen as a new-born babe, the God Who
is before all the ages.
