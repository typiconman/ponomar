<SERVICE Type="4"/><LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
Celebrating St. John the Baptizer of the Lord in memory of the transfer from Malta to the city of Gatchina of a cross from part of the wood of the life- creating cross of the Lord, the wonderworking icon of the Mother of God (Philermia) written by the Holy Evangelist Luke, and the right hand from the relics of St. John the Baptist. The Maltese knights protected these holy relics since the time of the Crusades and brought them to Gatchina as a gift to the Emperor Paul 1 in 1799. In the same year all these relics were transferred to St. Petersburg, to a church of the Winter Palace. Since 1852 annually on October 11 these relics are brought to the church of the Gatchina Palace, from where on October 12 they in a cross procession are transferred to the Gatchina cathedral, where they remain for 10 days for veneration and prayer services by all the people.        A special service was written for this feast, but since 1800 it was only marked on calendars and was not celebrated anywhere. In 1852, when the St. Paul’s Cathedral was constructed in Gatchina, the celebration of the feast was restored which was also performed annually in the Gatchina Palace church and in the St. Paul’s Cathedral.
