<NAME Nominative="Martyr Epimachus"/> 
<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
       He was born in Egypt and from the first for a long time was an ascetic in desert
solitude on the hills of Pelusium. During the persecution of Christians in Alexandria,
St. Epimachus, burning with zealousness for the true faith, went into the city,
destroyed pagan altars and firmly preached Christ to the pagans. After enduring many
tortures he was beheaded for this in about the year 250.
