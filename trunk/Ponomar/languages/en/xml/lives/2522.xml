       Born in Spain, he was a deacon in the city of Augustopolis. During
the persecution of Christian under Diocletian he was given over for
crucifixion in the city of Valencia. Miraculously saved from death on the
cross, St. Vincent then was burnt on an iron grid. His relics today repose in
Rome.

In their sufferings, O Lord,/ Thy martyrs received imperishable crowns from Thee our God;/ for, possessed of Thy might,/ they set at nought the tormentors and crushed the feeble audacity of the demons.// By their supplications save Thou our souls.
