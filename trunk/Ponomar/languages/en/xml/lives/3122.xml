<TROPARION Tone="4">
O most glorious Paul, we hymn thee/ as one who dwelleth together with the incorporeal hosts/ and as a companion of all the venerable,// and we beseech thee:// Pray thou ever for us, that we may find mercy.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="8" Podoben="2">
From thy youth, O wise one, thou didst manfully desire that which passeth understanding/ and didst forsake the tumult of the world./ For thy divine way of life thou becamest a dwelling-place of the Trinity,/ and hast illumined those who have recourse to thee with faith.// Wherefore, we cry out: Rejoice, O Paul who art most rich!
