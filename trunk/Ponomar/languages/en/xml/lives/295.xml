&lt;p&gt;Saint Athanasias and Cyril, Archbishops of Alexandria, have a conjoined feast established to them in acknowledgement of the profound gratitude of Holy Church for their incessant lengthy labour in affirmation of the dogmas of the Orthodox faith and their zealous defense of such against heretical teachings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The account about Saint Athanasias is located under 2 May, and about Saint Cyril—under 9 June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shining forth with works of Orthodoxy and reducing all heresy to ashes, * ye were victors and conquerors, enriching all with piety; * and, having greatly adorned the Church, * ye have acquired Christ God, as is meet, ** Who granteth us great mercy.
