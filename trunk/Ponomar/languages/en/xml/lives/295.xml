<TROPARION Tone="4">
O God of our fathers,/ deal with us ever according to Thy meekness./ Deprive us not of Thy mercy,/ but through their supplications// direct our life in peace.
</TROPARION>
<TROPARION Tone="3">
	Shining forth with works of Orthodoxy and reducing all heresy to ashes,/ ye were victors and conquerors, enriching all with piety;/ and, having greatly adorned the Church,/ ye have acquired Christ God, as is meet,// Who granteth us great mercy.

<KONTAKION Tone="4">
O sacred primates most great, champions of the Church of Christ,/ preserve all who chant:// Save those who honor Thee with faith, O Compassionate One!
</KONTAKION>
<KONTAKION Tone="2" Podoben="6">
Planting Orthodox doctrine, thou didst cut down the tares of heresy,/ causing the seed of faith to increase/ through the rain of the Spirit, O venerable one.// Wherefore, we hymn thee, O Athanasius.
