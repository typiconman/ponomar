He was the founder and rector of the Transfiguration Monastery on the Sokhoti River, about 25 versts (16.5 miles) from Poshekhonie, Iaroslavl Province. Ven. Sebastian lived in the 15th century, distinguished by a highly virtuous life and extraordinary diligence. He frequently loved to repeat this to his disciples: &quot;brethren, suffer grief and misfortune that you may avoid eternal torment&quot;. He died in 1542. His relics are in a hidden place in his monastery (see Iaroslavl Diocese).
