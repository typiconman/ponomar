These holy martyrs suffered deeply for Christ during the reign of theEmperor Diocletian in Sebaste, Armenia. St. Eustratius, &quot;the accuser ofHellenic thinkers of fables and preacher of Christian divine wisdom&quot;, wasthe magistrate of Satalios. For his belief in Christ, being &quot;relentlesslybeaten, and burned in fire, and nailed in his boots with iron, and driven on the way,and enclosed in prison&quot;, he was burned to death after these severe tortures. Auxentius,&quot;who with wise words and patience became a martyr exposing godlessness&quot;, waspresbyter of the Arabian church and, after being &quot;tested by various torments,confessing Christ God&quot;, died, being beheaded by the sword. Eugene, &quot;needed by Godfor good and not needed for torture was saved by his confession&quot;, and Mardarius, &quot;themeek dove&quot;, were voluntarily led into martyrdom for the sake of Christ and died whilebeing tortured. St. Orestes, &quot;a true and wonderful warrior for every Caesar&quot;, whofound his faith in Christ by the cross on his chest, after being tortured &quot;was burned onan iron griddle&quot;, received &quot;a blessed end to his life and an incorruptible crown&quot;. Therelics of these holy martyrs repose in Rome.

<TROPARION Tone="4">
In their sufferings, O Lord,/ Thy martyrs received imperishable crowns from Thee our God;/ for, possessed of Thy might,/ they set at nought the tormentors and crushed the feeble audacity of the demons.// By their supplications save Thou our souls.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="2" Podoben="4">
Thou hast been shown to be a most splendid luminary,/ for those who sit in the darkness of ignorance, O passion-bearer;/ for, armed with faith as with a spear,/ thou wast undaunted by the arrogance of the enemy, O Eustratius,// who art far more eloquent than any orator.
</KONTAKION>
<KONTAKION Tone="3" Podoben="1">
Speaking of divine things eloquently before the iniquitous, O all-wondrous one,/ thou didst endure beatings with most courageous heart,/ didst shine forth with godly signs,/ and didst extinguish the towering flame of falsehood.// Wherefore, we honor thee, O most blessed Eustratius, martyr of Christ.
</KONTAKION>
