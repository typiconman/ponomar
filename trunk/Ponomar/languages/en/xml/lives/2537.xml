<SERVICE Type="0"/><LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
St. Justinian was born a Slav. The famous Greek emperor, fortunate in wars with the enemies of the empire, was also zealous in rooting out paganism as a real adherent of Orthodoxy, as a fervent law-giver (under him the code of church - civil laws was made), and as the mediator of church disputes he was both voluntarily and truly a pious person. He built the St. Sophia temple in Constantinople and many other temples and hospitals. He called the Fifth Ecumenical Council and wrote the church hymn "Only-begotten Son" in refutation of the Nestorian heresy. He died in 565 and for his service to the Church and devout life he was added to the choir of saints. St. Theodora became a faithful wife of the Emperor from being a sinner and became the defender of Orthodoxy from being the patroness of the Monophysite heresy. She died in 548.
