<TROPARION Type="1" Tone="4">
Having dedicated thyself wholly to the Lord from thy youth, thou becamest a model of virtue in prayers, labors and fasting; wherefore, beholding thy goodly intent, God appointed thee the hierarch and pastor of His Church: and for this cause, thy precious body hath been preserved whole and incorrupt after thy repose. O holy hierarch Jonah, entreat Christ God, that He save our souls.

<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="0">
From childhood thou didst enslave thyself unto the Lord, O wise one, laying waste to thy body through fasting and the keeping of vigils; wherefore, thou wast shown to be the pure vessel and abode of the all-holy Spirit. For this cause He ordained thee as hierarch and pastor for His Church, and having tended it well, thou didst depart unto the Lord Whom thou didst love. We therefore beseech thee: Be thou mindful of us who honor thy holy memory with faith, that we may all cry aloud unto thee: Rejoice, O father Jonah, most honored and holy hierarch!
