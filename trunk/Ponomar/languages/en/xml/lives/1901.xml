&lt;p&gt;Saint Sava, first Archbishop of Serbia,—in the world Rostislav (Rastko), was a son of the Serbian autocrat Stefan Nemani and Anna, daughter of the Greek emperor Romanos. From his early years he fervently attended church services and fostered an especial love for icons. At seventeen years of age, having met a Russian monk from Holy Mount Athos, Rostislav secretly left his father’s house and set off to the Russian Panteleimonov monastery. (By Divine Providence in the year of the saint’s birth—1169—the ancient monastery of the great-martyr and healer Panteleimon was restored for eternal keeping to Russian monks.) Knowing that his son was on Athos, his father mobilised his retainers headed by a faithful vœvoda and wrote to the governor of the district which included Athos, that if his son were not returned to him, he would go to war against the Greeks. Having arrived at the monastery, the vœvoda  * military-chief was ordered not to take his eyes off Rostislav. During the time of evening Divine-services, when the soldiers were fallen asleep under the influence of wine, Rostislav took monastic vows (the year 1186) and sent to his parents his worldly clothes, his hair and a letter. The monk Sava sought to persuade his powerful parents to accept monasticism. The monk’s father (the commemoration of the Monk Stefan, in monasticism Simeon, Tsar of Serbia, is situated under 13 February) together with his son pursued asceticism at the Batopedeia monastery. On Athos they established the Serbian Khilendaria monastery, and this monastery received its name by imperial stauropegia  * grant. At Khilendaria monastery, the monk Save was ordained to the deaconate and then presbyter. For his monastic deeds on Mount Athos, the monk was deemed worthy of the dignity of archimandrite at Soluneia  * Thessalonika. At Niciea in the year 1219 on the feast of the Dormition  * Uspenie of the Most Holy Mother of God, the Œcumenical Pattriarch Germanos ordained archimandrite Sava to the dignity of Archbishop of All Serbia. For this the monk petitioned the Greek emperor for permission that the Archbishop be consecrated by a Sobor of bishops in Serbia—a very important consideration in this time of frequent wars between eastern and western powers. Having returned to the Holy Mountain from Nicæa, the saint made the rounds of all the monasteries for the last time; he made prostration in all the churches and, calling to mind the blessed lives of the wilderness fathers, he made his farewells with the ascetics in deep remorse, “leaving from the Holy Mountain, as though from some Divine paradise.” Dejected by his grievous separation from the Holy Mountain, the saint went along the path from Athos just barely moving. Only the words of the Most Holy Mother of God that had come to the saint in a dream—”having My Patronage to the King of all, My Son and God, about what dost thou still sorrow?”—these words roused him from despondency, changing sorrow into joy. In memory of this appearance, the saint commissioned at Soluneia large icons of the Saviour and of the Mother of God, and put them in the Church of the Philokalia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Serbia, the activity of the Hierarch in organising the work of his native Church was accompanied by numerous signs and miracles. During the time of Liturgy and the all-night vigil, when the saint came to cense over the grave of his father the monk Simeon, the holy relics exuded fragrant myrh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being in charge of negotiations with the Hungarian king Vladislav, who had declared war on Serbia, the glorious sainted bishop with heavenly signs not only brought about the desired peace for his country, he also brought the Hungarian monarch to Orthodoxy. Having secured a beginning for the historical existence of the autonomous Serbian Church, Saint Sava contributed also to the strengthening of the Serbian state. In order to insure the independence of the Serbian state, the holy archbishop Sava crowned his powerful brother Stefan as tsar. Upon the death of Stefan—his eldest son Radislav having been crowned tsar, Saint Sava set off to the Holy Land “with tears to worship at the holy grave of Christ and fearsome Golgotha.” Having returned to his native land, the saint gave his blessing and crowned Vladislav as tsar; to further strengthen the Serbian throne, he betrothed him with the daughter of the Bulgarian prince Asan. The holy hierarch made the rounds of all the Serbian land, he reformed monastic rules on the model of the athonites and palestinians, and he established and consecrated many churches, strengthening the Orthodox in their faith. Having finished his work in his native land, the saint appointed as his successor the priestmonk Arsenii, ordaining him bishop and giving his blessing to all. He then set off on a journey of no return, wanting “to end his days as a wanderer in a foreign land.” He passed through all of Palestine, through Syria and Persia, Babylon, Egypt and Anatolia, everywhere visiting the holy places, conversing with great ascetics, and gathering up the priestly remains of saints. The saint finished his wanderings at Trnovo in Bulgaria at the home of his kinsman Tsar Asan, where with spiritual joy he offered up his soul to the Lord († 1237). At the time of transfer of the holy relics of Saint Sava to Serbia in 1237 the healings were so numerous, that the Bulgarians began to complain about Asan, “that he had given up such a treasure.” In the saint’s own native country, his venerable relics were placed in the Church of Mileshevo, bestowing healing on all who approach with faith. The inhabitants of Trnovo continued to receive healing from the remnants of the grave of the saint, which pious Asan ordered to be gathered together and placed in a newly built sarcophagus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legacy of Saint Sava lives on in the orthodox Church traditions of the Slavic nations. With his legacy is linked the first introduction of the Jerusalem Ustav to Slavic Monastic Rules: the Serbian Khilendaria monastery on Athos lives by the Typikon of Saint Sava to the present time. The redactions of the book “The Rudder” belonging to the Saint Bishop—with the commentaries of Alexis Aristines, are the most widely disseminated in the Russian Church. In the year 1270 the first copy of “The Rudder” of Saint Sava was sent from Bulgaria to the metropolitan of Kiev Kirill. From this was copied one of the most ancient of the Russian “Rudders”—the Ryazansk “Rudder” of 1284. It in its turn was the source for a printed “Rudder”—published in the year 1653 and invariably since that time republished in the Russian Church. Such was the legacy of Saint Sava to the canonical treasury of Orthodoxy.&lt;/p&gt;
