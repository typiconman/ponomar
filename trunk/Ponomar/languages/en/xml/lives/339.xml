Saint Censorinus was an high-ranking dignitary during the reign of the Roman emperor Claudius II (268-270). Through a denunciation, he was arrested and locked up in prison for his faith in Christ. There by the Name of the Lord Jesus Christ he raised up a dead person, -- as a result of which 20 soldiers, prison guards, were converted to Christ. They were beheaded together with Saint Censorinus. Then there was brought for interrogation the maiden Chrysia, who bravely confessed herself a Christian and was subjected to torture. After horrible torments she was drowned in the sea.  	Saint Sabinus they struck at with an heavy hammer, and then they hung the body on a tree and burnt it. In his torments he gave up his holy soul to the Lord. 	With Saint Chrysia suffered the Martyrs: Filiclus, Maximus, Herculinus, Venerius, Stiracinus, Minus, Commodus, Hermes, Maurus, Eusebius, Rusticus, Monagreus, Amandinus, Olympius, Cyprus, Theodore, Tribunus, Maximus the Presbyter, Archelaus the Deacon and Cyrenus the Bishop.
