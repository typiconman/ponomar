<NAME Nominative="Our Venerable Father Cosmas of the Holy City, Bishop of Maium, and Author of Canons"/> 
<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
       He was the closest friend and co-worker of the Venerable John of
Damascus. For his piety he was installed as the Bishop of Maium, and worked very
hard in this position for his flock and died in peace at the end of the Eighth Century (after 776). Glorifying the hierarch as "nourisher of wisdom, "nurse of purity",
"enlightener of the faithful" and "renowned theologian", the Holy Church
witnesses that Bishop Cosmas was "meek and humble of mind, calm and blameless
in speech, kind and guileless, chaste and righteous, most simple and wholesome".
Brought up "in piety and faith" and "with the mind and soul adorned in wisdom",
Bishop Cosmas adorned the Church "with systematic and didactic hymns",
satisfying "reason", and "which clearly open to all" "the truly strange and most
wonderful mysteries of Christ".

O God-inspired Cosmas, thou hast adorned thyself with virtues,
adorning the church of Christ with hymns, O Blessed One.
But pray to the Lord that He may deliver us from the snares of our enemies, as we cry out to thee: rejoice, O most richly adorned Father.
