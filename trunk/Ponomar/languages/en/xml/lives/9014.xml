<TROPARION Tone="4">
Make ready, O Zebulon!/ Adorn thyself, O Nephthali!/ O River Jordan, leaping up,/ receive thou the Master Who cometh to be Baptized!/ Rejoice, O Adam, with our first mother!/ Hide not yourselves as ye did before in paradise;/ for He that beheld you naked hath appeared,/ that He may clothe you in your primal raiment.// Christ hath appeared, desiring to make all creation new!
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="4" Podoben="1">
In the streams of the Jordan the Lord crieth out to John today:/ Fear not to baptize Me,// for I have come to save Adam the first-created!
