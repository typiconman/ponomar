The Venerable Amphilocius already a monk came to the Glushetsk monastery to assist its rector the Venerable Dionysius (June 1). And he became the most reliable helper for Dionysius during the building of the monastery, strictly supervising and observing the monastery Typikon (Ustav) for twenty years. His meekness and humility was immeasurable; he cared only for the soul, which is why he wore the most modest clothing. After the death of his guide he became the hegumen of the monastery and died in peace in 1452. His relics are in a hidden place in the temple named for him. The Venerable Macarius succeeded him. He was born in Rostov, and spent twelve years in ascetic efforts in the Glushetsk Monastery and died in 1478. His relics are in a hidden place in the Glushetsk Monastery. The Venerable Tarasius was the hegumen of one of the monasteries built by Bishop Stephen (see April 26) and was one of his fervent co-workers in the propagation and the establishment of the Orthodox faith among the Zirians. Having entered into voluntary obedience to the Venerable Dionysius, he practiced asceticism in the Glushetsk Monastery for ten years, leading a most severe and strict life in fasting and vigils, destroying his body. Tears of affection constantly moistened his cheeks, testifying to his deep humility and afflicted heart, so that all marveled at his patience and looked upon him as on one of the ancient great ascetics. Reaching deep old age, he died in 1440. His relics are in a hidden place in the Glushetsk St. Dionysius Monastery (see the Vologda Diocese). The Venerable Theodosius was a disciple of the Venerable Dionysius. His relics repose in the same Glushetsk Monastery, near the relics of the Venerable Tarasius.
