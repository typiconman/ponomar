The God-wise, God-blest and Blessed Anna was the daughter of the priest Nathan and his wife Mary, from the tribe of Levi by descent of Aaron. According to tradition, she died peacefully in Jerusalem at age 79, before the Annunciation of the MostHoly Virgin Mary. During the reign of the holy Saint Justinian the Emperor (527-565), a church was built in her honour at Deutera. And emperor Justinian II (685695; 705-711) restored her church, since Righteous Anna had appeared to his pregnant wife. And it was at this time that her body and omaphorion (veil) were transferred to Constantinople. (The account about Righteous Joakim and Anna is located under 9September).

O divinely wise Anna,/ in thy womb thou didst bear the pure Mother of God, who gave birth unto Life./ Wherefore, rejoicing in glory,/ thou hast now been translated to the mansions of heaven, where is the abode of those who rejoice./ / O ever-blessed one, beseech thou cleansing of transgressions for those who honor thee with love.
