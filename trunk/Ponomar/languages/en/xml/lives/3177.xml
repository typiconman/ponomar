On the second day of the Nativity of Christ the Holy Church invites its faithful children for the thanksgiving glorification of the All-holy Virgin, who has contributed to the great mystery of the incarnation of the Son of God. Because of this the day is called the &quot;Synaxis of the All-holy Theotokos&quot;

<TROPARION Tone="4">
Thy nativity, O Christ our God,/ hath shone forth the light of knowledge upon the world;/ for therein those who worship the stars/ have been taught by a star to worship Thee,/ the Sun of righteousness,/ and to know Thee the Orient from on high.// O Lord, glory be to Thee!
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="3">
Today the Virgin giveth birth unto the Transcendent One,/ and the earth offereth a cave to the unapproachable One./ Angels and shepherds give glory,/ the magi journey with the star.// For unto us a Child is born, the preeternal God.
</KONTAKION>
<KONTAKION Tone="6">
He Who was born of the Father without mother before the morning star/ hath today become incarnate of thee on earth without father;/ wherefore, the star announceth glad tidings to the magi,// and the angels and shepherds hymn thine ineffable birthgiving, O thou who art full of grace.
</KONTAKION>
