<TROPARION Tone="4">
Thou didst right-pleasingly attain unto virtue, O martyr,/ and becamest a pure habitation of Christ, the beloved abode of the Holy Spirit./ Wherefore, suffering well,/ thou didst put to shame the enemy who wageth war upon the human race./ and didst cut down Copronymus with the sword of the Faith, O Theodosia;/ and, rejoicing, thou hast passed over to the heavenly bridal-chamber.// Ask thou great mercy for those who ever honor thee with faith.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="2" Podoben="3">
Through labors thou didst attain unto the life abounding in ease, O martyr,/ and with thy blood thou didst choke Copronymus,/ the enemy of the Church of Christ,/ O most blessed Theodosia;/ and thou dost rejoice with the armies on high,// protecting those who honor thy memory.
</KONTAKION>
