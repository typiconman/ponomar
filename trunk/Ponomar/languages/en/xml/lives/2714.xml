&lt;p&gt;Thou didst right-pleasingly attain unto virtue, O martyr, * and becamest a pure habitation of Christ, the beloved abode of the Holy Spirit. * Wherefore, suffering well, * thou didst put to shame the enemy who wageth war upon the human race. * and didst cut down Copronymus with the sword of the Faith, O Theodosia; * and, rejoicing, thou hast passed over to the heavenly bridal-chamber. ** Ask thou great mercy for those who ever honor thee with faith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through labors thou didst attain unto the life abounding in ease, O martyr, * and with thy blood thou didst choke Copronymus, * the enemy of the Church of Christ, * O most blessed Theodosia; * and thou dost rejoice with the armies on high, ** protecting those who honor thy memory.&lt;/p&gt;
