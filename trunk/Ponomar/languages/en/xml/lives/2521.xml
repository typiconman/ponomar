The Holy Martyr Victor suffered for Christ in the city of Damascus, during the reign of the Emperor Antoninus. St. Victor was born in Italy.

In their sufferings, O Lord, * Thy martyrs received imperishable crowns from Thee our God; * for, possessed of Thy might, * they set at nought the tormentors and crushed the feeble audacity of the demons. ** By their supplications save Thou our souls.
