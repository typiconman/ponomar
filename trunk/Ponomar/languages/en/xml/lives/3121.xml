&lt;p&gt;       His mother, Anthia, brought up St. Eleutherius, the son of a famous Roman citizen, in Christian piety. “Having fixed his most pure mind to God from youth,” he “removed fleshly wisdom from his soul and bountifully enriched himself with the grace of wonders.” His good works were so great, that at 20 years of age he was already installed as the Bishop of Illyricum (Albania). During the reign of Hadrian St. Eleutherius after being tortured was beheaded in Rome together with St. Anthia for zealously preaching Christ. The Eparch Choribus, who tortured Eleutherius, himself believed in Christ and also was beheaded. The relics of St. Eleutherius repose in Rome. The Holy Martyr Anthia is not mentioned in the church services by name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As thou didst share in the ways of the apostles * and didst occupy their throne, * thou didst find thine activity to be a passage to divine vision, * O divinely inspired one. * Wherefore, ordering the word of truth, * thou didst suffer for the Faith even to the shedding of thy blood. ** O hieromartyr Eleutherius, entreat Christ God, that our souls be saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all praise thee as the adornment of priests * and the proclamation of passion-bearers, * O venerable hieromartyr Eleutherius, * and we entreat thee: * From multifarious misfortunes free those who celebrate thy memory with love, ** praying unceasingly for us all.&lt;/p&gt;
