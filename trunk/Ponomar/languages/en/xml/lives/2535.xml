<NAME Nominative="Holy and All-praised Apostle Philip (1&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; C)" Short="Holy and"/>
<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
<p>From among the 12, he was born in Bethsaida. After the Descent of the Holy Spirit, he preached the Gospel in Galilee, and then in Greece, Arabia, Ethiopia, Syria and Asia Minor, enlightening "with the light of wisdom" and "with the lightning of preaching to those sitting in the darkness of ignorance". His preaching was accompanied by many miracles: in Galilee he raised a child from the dead; in Greece one leader together with the people wanted to kill St. Philip for his sermon, but was then struck with blindness and only through the prayer of the apostle received his sight. With the spread of Christianity during the reign of the Emperor Domitian the Holy Apostle Philip together with the Holy Apostle Barnabas (see June 11), on an order of the town mayor, were arrested, dragged through the streets suffering beatings and curses, were then thrown into prison and sentenced to crucifixion. The Holy Apostle Philip, with pierced feet and crucified on the cross with his head down, was hanged high up on a tree in the city of Hierapolis.</p>
