                                           The Venerable Eustolia from her youth devoted
herself to the service of God in the reign of the Emperor Maurice coming from Rome to
Constantinople. Here wishing to become a monastic she met Sosipatra, the daughter of
the Emperor Maurice. Both were ascetics, with the assistance of the Emperor, who
arranged for a women's monastery in Constantinople in which they served the Lord up to
the end. The Venerable Eustolia died in 610. The Venerable Sosipatra died in 625.
