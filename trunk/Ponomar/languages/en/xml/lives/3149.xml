&lt;p&gt;He was born in Mediolanum (Milan) where he served the Lord as a deacon. Elesbaan, King of Ethiopia (see Oct. 24), after defeating Dunaan, King of the Omirites in 528, asked Patriarch Asterius of Alexandria that he send a worthy shepherd for the Omirite see. After a revelation from above, Asterius consecrated Deacon Gregory to be the Archbishop of the Omirites. In Tafar, the capital of the Omirite Kingdom (in southern Arabia), St. Gregory converted many people to Christ, built churches and after ruling his flock for 30 years died in peace in 552. St. Gregory while still living became glorified for many miracles. &lt;/p&gt;
