Having learned from the Magi about the birth of the King of the Jews, our Lord Jesus Christ, and being afraid that this King would deprive him of his throne, Herod commanded that all children of the male gender two years old and younger be killed in Bethlehem and its vicinity. This inhuman decree was fulfilled, but, on the command of God, the holy family fled to Egypt (see Dec. 26). Near the cave of the Nativity of Christ (see page 230) there is a cave where the Roman Catholics built an altar in the name of the Holy Children Martyrs and where their sacred remains are stored behind an iron grating.

By the pangs of Thy saints,/ wherewith they suffered for Thee,/ be entreated O Lord, and heal all our pains,// O Thou Who lovest mankind.

The star sent the magi to Him Who was born,/ and Herod cruelly sent an unjust army,// seeking to slay Him Who lay as a babe in the manger.
