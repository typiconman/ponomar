The Sobor of the ArchAngel Gabriel is celebrated on the day following after the Annunciation/Blagoveschenie, ie. 26 March. This feast is celebrated a second time 13 July. The reason for its being established probably served the dedication in the XVII Cent. of a church at Constantinople, constructed in the name of the Holy Archi-Strategos / Chief of the Heavenly Hosts. 	An account of the Holy ArchAngel is located under 26 March and 8 November.

<TROPARION Tone="4">
Supreme commander of the armies of Heaven,/ we, the unworthy, do ever entreat thee,/ that by thy prayers thou ever surround us with the protection of the wings of thine immaterial glory,/ preserving us that earnestly fall down before thee and cry aloud:// Deliver us from misfortunes, in that thou art the leader of the hosts on high.

<KONTAKION Tone="2">
O wise Gabriel, thou leader of the angels,/ minister of the glory of God and divine champion of the world,/ who beholdest the glory of God in the heavens/ and bestowest grace on earth:/ save and preserve those who cry out to thee:// Be thou thyself our helper, and no one will prevail against us!
