&lt;p&gt; The synaxis of the Archangel Gabriel is celebrated on the day following the Annunciation, that is, March 26&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;. This feast is celebrated a second time on July 13&lt;supth&lt;/sup&gt;. The reason for it being established probably served the dedication in the 17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century of a church at Constantinople, constructed in the name of the Holy Chief (Archistrategos) of the Heavenly Hosts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An account of the Holy Archangel is located under 26 March and 8 November.&lt;/p&gt;
