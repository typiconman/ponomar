<TROPARION Type="1" Tone="0">
With the streams of thy tears thou didst irrigate the barren desert, * and with sighs from the depths of thy soul thou didst render thy labors fruitful an hunÂ­dredfold. * Thou wast a beacon for the whole world, radiating miracles. ** O our father Nilus, entreat Christ God that our souls be saved.

<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="0">
In thy vigilant prayer thou didst cut down the underbrush * of the uprising of the passions of the body as with a scythe. * As thou hast boldness before the Lord, free me from every misfortune, ** that I may cry out to thee: Rejoice, O universal father!
