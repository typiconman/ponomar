At first he was an eparch (leader) of Constantinople, but later, caring for his salvation, he left for Mount Sinai and there in a cave he spent his life in strict fasting and prayer. In this way the Venerable Nilus pursued his ascetical efforts for 60 years and died about the year 450.

<TROPARION Type="1" Tone="0">
With the streams of thy tears thou didst irrigate the barren desert, * and with sighs from the depths of thy soul thou didst render thy labors fruitful an hun­dredfold. * Thou wast a beacon for the whole world, radiating miracles. ** O our father Nilus, entreat Christ God that our souls be saved.

<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="0">
In thy vigilant prayer thou didst cut down the underbrush * of the uprising of the passions of the body as with a scythe. * As thou hast boldness before the Lord, free me from every misfortune, ** that I may cry out to thee: Rejoice, O universal father!
