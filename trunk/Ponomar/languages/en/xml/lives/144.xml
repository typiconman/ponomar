 The Martyr Gordias was born at the end of the III Century in the city of Caesarea Cappadocia into a Christian family. Coming of age, he entered military service, and having displayed valour and military skill, he was made a centurion. During the time of persecution of Christians at the beginning of the IV Century, he left the world and settled in the wilderness, so as to prepare himself for the good deed of confessing the Name of Christ the Saviour. In the year 320 Gordias openly came forward before the prefect of the city in defense of Christians. They arrested him and after terrible torments they beheaded him.

 In his suffering, O Lord,/ Thy martyr Gordius received an imperishable crown from Thee our God;/ for, possessed of Thy might,/ he set at nought the tormentors and crushed the feeble audacity of the demons.// By his supplications save Thou our souls.

 The drops of thy sweat have watered the whole earth, O all-glorious Gordius,/ and thou hast gladdened the whole world with thy precious blood./ By thy supplications, O divinely wise one, save all who hymn and bless thee with faith,// crying out a worthy hymn to thee, O most lauded one, as a great athlete.
