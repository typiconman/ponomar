The Monk Akhila (Aquila), Deacon of Pechersk (XIV), became famous as a great faster, having spent a long while as an hermit. Legend says that he ate neither vareny (pirogi) nor sweet food, he partook vegetables seldom and in small quantity, and during periods of fast he tasted of only one prosphora.  	To the intercession of Saint Akhila flee those thirsting of soul to be delivered from &quot;the enslavement of stomach passions&quot; and those wishing to learn temperance (3rd song of the Kanon to the Monks, venerated in the Farther Caves). 	The commemoration of the Monk Akhila is also 28 August and on the 2nd Sunday of Great Lent.
