during the reign of Emperor Diocletian in Melitene. St. Hieron was born in Tyana,
Cappadocia and was glorified for his courage and strength. Not wishing to enter
into the ranks of the warriors as in an army it was impossible to hide his faith. He
was seized by force and, for his confession of Christ, they cut off his hands and
imprisoned him together with other Christians. After being tortured all the Holy
Martyrs were beheaded. All these holy martyrs are mentioned in the services by
name.

<TROPARION Tone="4" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
In their sufferings, O Lord,/ Thy martyrs received imperishable crowns from Thee our God;/ for, possessed of Thy might,/ they set at nought the tormentors and crushed the feeble audacity of the demons.// By their supplications save Thou our souls.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="8" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
The radiant choir of martyrs, the luminous company,/ descending to us noetically, hath illumined the Church today with wondrous rays./ Wherefore, celebrating their honored memory, we ask of Thee, O our Savior:/ through their supplications delivÂ­er us from misfortunes,// that we may chant unto Thee: Alleluia!
