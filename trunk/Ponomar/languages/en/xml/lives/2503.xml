&lt;p&gt;In their sufferings, O Lord, * Thy martyrs received imperishable crowns from Thee our God; * for, possessed of Thy might, * they set at nought the tormentors and crushed the feeble audacity of the demons. ** By their supplications save Thou our souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having suffered mightily, * the two martyrs cast the arrogance of the enemy down to the ground, * being illumined by the grace of the uncreated Tfinity, * O glorious Onesiphorus and Porphyrius. ** Pray ye unceasingly in behalf of us all.&lt;/p&gt;
