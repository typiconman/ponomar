<TROPARION Type="1" Tone="4">
As thou didst share in the ways of the apostles and didst occupy their throne, thou didst find thine activity to be a passage to divine vision, O divinely inspired one. Wherefore, ordering the word of truth, thou didst suffer for the Faith even to the shedding of thy blood. O hieromartyr Phocas, entreat Christ God, that our souls be saved.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="6">
Offering up sacrifices as a high priest, O father, in the end thou didst offer thyself as a living sacrifice, bearing witness lawfully to Christ God, accepting death and strengthened by angels, who cried out to thee: Come with us, O Phocas, and no-one will be against us!
