&lt;p&gt;As thou didst share in the ways of the apostles * and didst occupy their throne, * thou didst find thine activity to be a passage to divine vision, * O divinely inspired one. * Wherefore, ordering the word of truth, * thou didst suffer for the Faith even to the shedding of thy blood. ** O hieromartyr Phocas, entreat Christ God, that our souls be saved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Offering up sacrifices as a high priest, O father, * in the end thou didst offer thyself as a living sacrifice, * bearing witness lawfully to Christ God, * accepting death and strengthened by angels, * who cried out to thee: ** Come with us, O Phocas, and no-one will be against us!&lt;/p&gt;
