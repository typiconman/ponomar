<TROPARION Tone="4">
As thou didst share in the ways of the apostles/ and didst occupy their throne,/ thou didst find thine activity to be a passage to divine vision,/ O divinely inspired one./ Wherefore, ordering the word of truth,/ thou didst suffer for the Faith even to the shedding of thy blood.// O hieromartyr Phocas, entreat Christ God, that our souls be saved.

<KONTAKION Tone="6" Podoben="1">
Offering up sacrifices as a high priest, O father,/ in the end thou didst offer thyself as a living sacrifice,/ bearing witness lawfully to Christ God,/ accepting death and strengthened by angels,/ who cried out to thee:// Come with us, O Phocas, and no-one will be against us!
