<NAME Nominative="Repose of Blessed Maxim of Moscow, the Fool-for-Christ († 1434)" Short="Maxim"/>
<SERVICE Type="2"/><LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
&lt;p&gt; He was tonsured in Moscow in the 15 century “He was righteous and gentle, truthful and chaste, avoided every evil thing” and “shining with piety”. Enduring both cold and heat, the Blessed Maximus dressed in sackcloth ran on streets of Moscow and with brief sayings taught the people with patience who accused him of sins. He died in 1433. In 1568 his relics were found incorruptible and were glorified with miracles. They repose in Moscow, in a temple of his name. See August 13. &lt;/p&gt;

<TROPARION Type="1" Tone="5">
With naked flesh and great patience thou uncovered the cunning of the enemy, exposing his impure deeds. Suffering greatly from scorching heat and biting frost, thou did not feel great need for fire, being covered by Divine help, O most wise Maximus. Pray for those who with faith are honorably keeping thy memory and are zealously hastening to the shrine of thy relics, that they may be delivered from troubles and falls.

<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="2">
Wishing for the higher beauty, thou hast reckoned as nothing the sweet delights of the flesh and attire, and thou hast loved poverty instead of this vain world, thou hast died leading the angelic way of life, O Blessed Maximus, With them pray unceasingly to Christ for us all.
