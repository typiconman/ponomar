<SERVICE Type="0"/><LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
Son of the Chernigov prince David Sviatoslavich, at first he reigned as prince in Lutsk, and then in Chernigov. Being married and having children, he left family, princedom and all earthly pleasures and in 1107 accepted monasticism in the Kievan Monastery of the Caves. Here he practiced asceticism as a simple monk fulfilling all monastic obedience, and conducted a life, full of any deprivation. Vainly the brothers of the prince tried to make him regret leaving his former rich and magnificent life. Blessed Nicholas spent his time in labor and prayer, fasting and vigil, for more than thirty years. Tradition informs us, that he built a church in honor of the Most Holy Trinity above the monastery gates, and also a hospital with a Temple of Saint Nicholas (near the Laura Gates). Eating only monastic food, venerable Nicholas distributed to the poor and strangers all that he received from his brothers, princes and boyars. Н died in 1143.                                                                           e Almost all Kievans were in the monastery to render their last duty to the blessed prince. Having been glorified with healing, his relics repose in the St. Anthony”s Cave. Even after death the clothes of Ven. Nicholas was a source of healing. So, when Prince Isiaslav became gravely ill, they placed on him the hair shirt of Venerable Nicholas and the ill person immediately recovered. The name "Sviatosha" stuck to Venerable Nicholas as a nickname for Sviatoslav, which was given him at birth. The service to him is with the polyeleos.
