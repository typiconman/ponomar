<TROPARION Tone="4">
O God of our fathers,/ deal with us ever according to Thy meekness./ Deprive us not of Thy mercy,/ but through their supplications// direct our life in peace.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="2" Podoben="3">
Forsaking the world, thou didst follow Christ from childhood,/ O all-wise and venerable Acacius,/ and, emulating His voluntary humility,/ thou didst cast down the prideful tyrant.// Pray thou unceasingly in behalf of us all.
</KONTAKION>
