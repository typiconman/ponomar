&lt;p&gt;In the year 846 the holy relics of Patriarch Nicephoros were opened, undecayed and fragrant. They transferred them from Prokonnis to Constantinople and placed them for one day in the church of Saint Sophia, and then they transferred them to the church of the Holy Apostles. The hands of the saint are preserved in the Khilendaria monastery on Mount Athos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The memory of Saint Nicephoros is celebrated also on 2 June.&lt;/p&gt;</LIFE>
