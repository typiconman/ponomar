From the church hymns for this day: &quot;Bethlehem prepare, Eden is opened for all, Make ready Ephratha&quot;, &quot;listen, mountains and hills, and lands around Judea&quot;, &quot;and the trees of the forest, rivers and seas and everything that breathes leap for joy&quot;: &quot;for see, the Son and Word of God the Father comes to be born of a maiden who knows not man&quot;. &quot;People, let us celebrate the Forefeast of the Nativity of Christ, and let us turn our mind toward Bethlehem, let us raise up thoughts and with spiritual eyes gaze upon the Virgin, who goes into a cave to give birth to the Lord of all&quot;. &quot;Let us cast away from us the sleep of idleness, and with wakefulness of soul let us prepare for Christ Who is brought to birth of a pure Maiden&quot;. &quot;Rejecting all the defilement of passion, let us take up a prudent disposition worthy of the coming of Christ&quot;; &quot;let us be humbled in spirit, that by good deeds we may exalt Him who is being born&quot;.

<TROPARION Tone="4">
Make ready, O Bethlehem!/ Open unto all, O Eden!/ Adorn thyself, O Ephratha!/ For the Tree of life hath blossomed forth from the Virgin in the cave./ Her womb is shown to be a noetic paradise,/ wherein lieth a divine garden,/ eating from whence we live,/ not dying like Adam.// Christ is born to raise up His image which before was fallen.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="3" Podoben="1">
Today the Virgin cometh to give birth ineffably/ to the preeternal Word in the cave./ Dance, O world! And having heard this,/ with the angels and shepherds glorify// the preeternal God, Who is to appear as a little babe.
</KONTAKION>
