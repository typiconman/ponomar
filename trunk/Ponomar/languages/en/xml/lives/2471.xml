He was the son of the Goth King Leovigild. His father, being an Arian, tried in every possible way to convert St. Hermenegild to Arianism and, not successful in this, imprisoned him. When, on the feast of Pascha, the Arian bishop was sent to the imprisoned son of the king in order to give him communion, St. Hermenegild refused to receive communion from the heretic and for this he was beheaded in the year 586.
