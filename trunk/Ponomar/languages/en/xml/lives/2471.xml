        He was the son of the Goth King Leovigild. His father, being an Arian, tried
in every possible way to convert St. Hermenegild to Arianism and, not successful
in this, imprisoned him. When, on the feast of Pascha, the Arian bishop was sent to
the imprisoned son of the king in order to give him communion, St. Hermenegild
refused to receive communion from the heretic and for this he was beheaded in the
year 586.
