&lt;p&gt;      They were ascetics in the Kievan Monastery of the Caves in the 12th Century. They were both of simple folk and were occupied in the monastery baking prosphora accompanied with the works of continual prayer and fasting. Their relics are in the St. Anthony Cave. The relics of St. Spiridon repose in such a way that the first three fingers on the right hand are combined for making the sign of the cross. &lt;/p&gt;
