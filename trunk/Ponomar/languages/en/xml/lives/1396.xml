&lt;p&gt;The Monk David of Soluneia (Thessalonika) pursued asceticism at the monastery of the holy Martyrs Theodore and Mercurios. Afterwards, having settled near the city of Soluneia, he built himself an hut under an almond tree and lived in it for 70 years, being in constant prayer, keeping strict fast, and enduring heat and cold. The Monk David received from God the gift of wonderworking, and he healed many from sickness. The holy ascetic gave spiritual counsel to all who came to him. Having attained to passionlessness, he was like an angel in the flesh, and without harm he was able to take into his hands the hot coals for the incensing. The monk died in about the year 540. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In thee, O father, that which was created according to the image of God was manifestly saved. * For accepting thy cross thou didst follow after Christ, * and praying thou didst learn to disdain the flesh, * for thou didst transcend it to take care of thine immortal soul. ** Wherefore, with the angels doth thy soul rejoice, O venerable David.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An ever-blossoming garden, bearing the fruits of the virtues, * thou didst appear in the tree of a grove, like a right melodious bird; * and receiving the Lord, the tree of life, in thy heart all the more, * and cultivating it like a garden, O divinely wise one, * thou hast thereby nurtured us with grace. ** Pray thou ever in our behalf, O most blessed David.&lt;/p&gt;
