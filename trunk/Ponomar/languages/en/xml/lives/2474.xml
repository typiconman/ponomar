 Blessed is the earth that was filled with your blood, O Passion-bearers of the Lord, and holy are the dwelling places that received your bodies. For you triumphed over the enemy in the stadium, and preached Christ with courage. We pray that you beseech Him, since He is Good, that our souls may be saved.
