<NAME Nominative="Holy Martyr Menas"/> 
<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
       Born in Egypt, a warrior, he during the persecution of the Emperor
Diocletian left military service and, having gone to the desert, in fasting and
prayer he was tonsured there. During one pagan feast he was revealed in the
city of Cotiaeum (in Phrygia) and began fearlessly to accuse the pagans of
their errors. St. Menas was immediately seized and turned over to the
cruelest tortures, after which with a sword they beheaded him (in the year
304). In a service for this day together with Menas the martyrs Sts. Victor,
Vincent and Stephanida are glorified; but the majority of the church hymns
are devoted in honor of the holy Martyr Menas.

<TROPARION Tone="4">
In their sufferings, O Lord,/ Thy martyrs received imperishable crowns from Thee our God;/ for, possessed of Thy might,/ they set at nought the tormentors and crushed the feeble audacity of the demons.// By their supplications save Thou our souls.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="4">
Christ our God, the imperishable Crown of martyrs,/ took thee, O passionbearer Minas, from a transient army,// and showed thee forth as a partaker of the incorruptÂ­ible and heavenly.
