<NAME Nominative="The Holy Apostles (from the 70): Stachys, Amplias and those with them (Urban, Narcissus, Apelles and Aristobulus)."/> 
<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Fr. Eugene Tarris">
      The Holy Apostle Andrew consecrated St. Stachys as Bishop of Byzantium,
over which he was hierarch for 16 years and died in peace. St. Amplias was Bishop in
Diospolis (Lydda), and St. Urban in Macedonia. The Apostle Andrew consecrated
both of them as bishops, and they zealously preached Christ to the pagans and for this
they died as martyrs from both Jews and Hellenes. St. Narcissus was bishop in
Athens. St. Apelles was hierarch in Heraclea. See March 16 concerning the Holy
Apostle Aristobulus. In the church services all these are called Holy Apostles.
