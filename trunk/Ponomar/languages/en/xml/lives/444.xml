&lt;p&gt;The Monk Auxentios, by origin a Syrian, served at the court of the emperor Theodosius the Younger (418-450). He was known as a virtuous, learned and wise man, and he was moreover a friend of many of the pious men of his era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Distressed by worldly vanity, Saint Auxentios accepted the dignity of presbyter, and then received monastic tonsure. Setting off after this to Bithynia, he found a solitary place on Mount Oxus, not far from Chalcedon, and there he began the life of an hermit. (This mountain was afterwards called Auxentian). The place of the saint’s efforts was stumbled upon by shepherds, seeking after lost sheep. They spread the news about him, and people began to come to him for healing. With the Name of God, Saint Auxentios healed many of the sick and the infirm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the year 451 Saint Auxentios was invited to the Fourth Œcumenical Council at Chalcedon, where he became known as a denouncer of the Eutykhian and Nestorian heresies. He was greatly familiar with Holy Scripture, and Saint Auxentios easily bested those opponents who entered into dispute with him. After the finish of the Council, Saint Auxentios returned again to his solitary cell on the mountain. By means of spiritual sight he saw the end of Saint Simeon the Pillar-Dweller (459), from over a great distance. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Monk Auxentios himself died in about the year 470, leaving behind him disciples and many monasteries constructed in the Bithynian region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A dweller in the desert, an angel in the flesh * and a wonder-worker wast thou shown to be, * O our God-bearing father Auxentius. * Receiving heavenly gifts through fasting, vigils and prayers, * thou healest the infirm * and the souls of those who with faith have recourse unto thee * Glory to Him Who hath given thee strength! * Glory to Him Who hath crowned thee! ** Glory to Him Who worketh healings for all through thee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delighting in abstinence and restraining the desires of thy flesh, * O divinely wise and sacred father Auxentius, * thou wast shown forth, shining with faith, ** and didst blossom like a plant in the midst of paradise.&lt;/p&gt;
