<NAME Nominative="Holy Martyrs Galaction and Epistime"/> 
<LIFE Id="bulgakov" Translator="Archpriest Eugene Tarris">
       They suffered for Christ during the persecution of Decius in the city of Emesa,
Phoenicia. St. Galaction, being a Christian, according to the will of his parents, was
betrothed to the pagan Epistime. Having instructed her in the holy faith, St. Galaction
convinced her to lead a virgin life, and was himself tonsured as a monk on Mount
Publion near Sinai. During the persecution when he was seized for torture, St.
Epistime voluntarily joined him to share with him the cup of suffering. After severe
tortures both holy martyrs were beheaded.

<TROPARION Tone="4" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
Thy martyrs, O Lord, through their sufferings have received incorruptible crowns from Thee, our God. For having Thy strength, they despoiled their adversaries, and shattered the powerless audacity of demons. Through their intercessions, save Thou our souls!
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="2" Translator="Aleksandr Andreev">
Thou hast been counted among the ranks of the martyrs of Christ,
having fought valiantly, thou brightly struggled,
O glorious Galaction, with thine honourable wife and fellow sufferer, Epistime; pray ye
unceasingly to the one God for us all.
