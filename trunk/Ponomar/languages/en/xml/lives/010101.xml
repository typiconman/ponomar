<TROPARION Tone="1">
O Jesus, Who in the highest dost sit with Thine unoriginate Father and the divine Spirit upon a fiery throne, Thou wast well-pleased to be born on earth of Thy Mother, a Maiden who knew not man; wherefore, thou wast circumcised as a babe eight days of age. Glory to Thine all-good counsel! Glory to Thy dispensation! Glory to Thy condescension, O Thou Who alone lovest mankind!
</TROPARION>
<TROPARION Tone="1">
Thy sound hath gone forth into all the earth, which hath received thy discourse, whereby thou didst divinely teach and make clear the nature of things, and didst adorn the ways of men. O venerable father, thou royal priesthood, entreat Christ God, that our souls be saved.
</TROPARION>
<KONTAKION Tone="3" Podoben="1">
The Lord of all endureth circumcision and, in that He is good, He cutteth away the transgressions of men and today granteth salvation to the world. And Basil, the high priest of the Creator, the radiant and divine initiate of the mysteries of Christ, rejoiceth on high.
</KONTAKION>
<KONTAKION Tone="4" Podoben="1">
Thou hast been shown to be the unshakable foundation of the Church, bestowing upon all men a dominion which cannot be taken away, and sealing them with thy precepts, O newly revealed and venerable Basil.
