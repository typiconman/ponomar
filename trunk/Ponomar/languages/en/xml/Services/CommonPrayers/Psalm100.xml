<HEADER Value="Psalm 100" />
<TEXT Value="Of mercy and judgment will I sing to Thee, O Lord; I will chant and have understanding in a blameless path. When wilt Thou come unto me?  I have walked in the innocence of my heart in the midst of my house.  I have no unlawful thing before mine eyes; the workers of transgressions I have hated.  A crooked heart hath not cleaved unto me; as for the wicked man who turned from me, I knew him not.  Him that privily talked against his neighbor did I drive away from me.  With him whose eye was proud and his heart insatiate, I did not eat.  Mine eyes were upon the faithful of the land, that they might sit with me; the man that walked in the blameless path, he ministered unto me.  The proud doer dwelt not in the midst of my house; the speaker of unjust things prospered not before mine eyes.  In the morning I slew all the sinners of the land, utterly to destroy out of the city of the Lord all them that work iniquity."/>
