<HEADER Value="Prayer of St. Basil the Great"/>
<TEXT Value="O Master, Lord Jesus Christ our God, Who art patient with our sins, and Who hast brought
us even to the present hour, in which, as Thou didst hang upon the life-giving Tree Thou didst
make a way into paradise for the penitent thief, and by Death didst destroy death, cleanse us
sinners, Thine unworthy servants; for we have sinned and have dealt iniquitously, and we are not
worthy to lift up our eyes and look upon the heights of heaven, inasmuch as we have departed from
the path of Thy righteousness, and have walked after the desires of our own hearts. But we implore
Thy boundless goodness. Spare us, O Lord, according to the multitude of Thy mercies, and save
us, for Thy holy Nameâ€™s sake; for our days have passed away in vanity. Wrest us from the hand of
the adversary, and forgive us our sins, and mortify in us carnal imagination; that, putting off the
old man, we may be clothed upon with the new man, and may live unto Thee, our Master and
Benefactor; that, following after Thy commandments, we may attain unto rest eternal, where is the
abode of all those who rejoice; for Thou art in verity the true Joy and Exultation of those who love
Thee, O Christ our God, and unto Thee we ascribe glory, together with the Father, Who is without
beginning, and Thine all-holy, good, and life-giving Spirit, now and ever, and unto ages of ages."/>
