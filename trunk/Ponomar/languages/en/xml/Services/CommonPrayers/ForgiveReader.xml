<TEXT Value="O most holy Trinity, consubstantial Power, undivided Kingship, the Cause of all good, be
gracious even to me, a sinner. Confirm and instruct my heart and take away from me every
defilement. Enlighten my mind that I may ever glorify, praise and worship Thee, saying: One is
holy; one is Lord, Jesus Christ, to the glory of God the Father. Amen."/>
