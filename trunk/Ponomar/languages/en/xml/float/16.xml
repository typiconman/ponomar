	<TROPARION Tone="2" Author="Traditional">Thou didst justify the Forefathers by faith, when of old through them Thou didst betroth Thyself to the Church of the nations. The Saints rejoice in the glorious fruit of their seed,/ even in her who bore Thee seedlessly. By their prayers, O Christ our God, save our souls.</TROPARION>
	<KONTAKION Tone="2" Author="Traditional">An image made with hands you would not worship, O thrice blessed three; but protected by the ineffable Essence you were glorified in  your ordeal by fire./ From the midst of the devouring flames you called upon God, crying: Hasten, O compassionate One, in Thy mercy come to our aid, for if Thou willest Thou canst.</KONTAKION>
