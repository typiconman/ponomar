IMPORTANT INFORMATION
In order to fully use the Ponomar JAVA programme, the following steps can be followed:
1) Install the font located in ChurchSlavonicTools/HirmosPonomarSIL.tff. Although this font is for primarily displaying Church Slavonic, it does contain special Typicon glyphs that are used by most of the other languages.
2) Install an sdk for JAVA. It is preferable that the 6.xx release be used, as the 7.xx version seems to have issues with proper display of Unicode characters.
3) Create the .class files using “javac *.java”.
4) From the root of this project, that is, at the same level as this file, type “java Ponomar.Main” and the main Ponomar Project interface should appear.
5) The folder ChurchSlavonicTools also contains a zipped file (cu.zip) that allows a Church Slavonic keyboard to be installed in Windows. This is a Unicode-compliant implementation of Church Slavonic that requires using the associated Hirmos Ponomar font.
