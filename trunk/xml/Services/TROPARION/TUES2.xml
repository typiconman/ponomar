<TEXT Value="<center><b>Troparion for Tuesday (Tone 2)</b></center><p>The memory of the righteous is in praise. And O Forerunner, the testimony of the Lord was sufficient for you; for in truth you have been revealed as nobler than all the prophets, having been considered worthy to baptize in running waters Him who was preached. Therefore, you strove for the truth happily. To those in Hell you proclaimed God Incarnate, who takes away the sin of the world, and who grants us great mercy.</p>"/>
