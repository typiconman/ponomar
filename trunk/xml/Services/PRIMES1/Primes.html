Attend unto the voice of my supplication, O my King and my God; for unto Thee will I pray, O Lord. In the morning shalt Thou hear my voice. In the morning shall I stand before Thee, and Thou shalt look upon me; for not a God that wiliest iniquity art Thou. He that worketh evil shall not dwell near Thee nor shall transgressors abide before Thine eyes.  Thou hast hated all them that work iniquity; Thou shalt destroy all them that speak a lie.  A man that is bloody and deceitful shall the Lord abhor.  But as for me, in the multitude of Thy mercy shall I go into Thy house; I shall worship toward Thy holy temple in fear of Thee.  O Lord, guide me in the way of Thy righteousness; because of mine enemies, make straight my way before Thee, For in their mouth there is no truth; their heart is vain. Their throat is an open sepulcher, with their tongues have they spoken deceitfully; judge them, O God.  Let them fall down on account of their own devisings; according to the multitude of their ungodliness, cast them out, for they have embittered Thee, O Lord. And let all them be glad that hope in Thee; they shall rejoice, and Thou shalt dwell among them. And all shall glory in Thee that love Thy name, for Thou shalt bless the righteous. O Lord, as with a shield of Thy good pleasure hast Thou crowned us.</p> <center><b>Psalm 89</b></center> <p>Lord, Thou hast been our refuge in generation and generation.  Before the mountains came to be and the earth was formed and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting art Thou.  Turn not man away unto lowliness; yea, Thou hast said: Turn back ye sons of men.  For a thousand years in Thine eyes, O Lord, are but as yesterday that is past, and as a watch in the night. Things of no account shall their years be; in the morning like grass shall man pass away.  In the morning shall he bloom and pass away. In the evening shall he fall and grow withered and dry.  For we have fainted away in Thy wrath, and in Thine anger have we been troubled.  Thou hast set our iniquities before us; our lifespan is in the light of Thy countenance.  For all our days are faded away, and in Thy wrath are we fainted away; our years have, like a spider, spun out their tale.  As for the days of our years, in their span, they be threescore years and ten.  And if we be in strength, mayhap fourscore years; and what is more than these is toil and travail.  For mildness is come upon us, and we shall be chastened.  Who knoweth the might of Thy wrath? And out of fear of Thee, who can recount Thine anger?  So make Thy right hand known to me, and to them that in their heart are instructed in wisdom.  Return, O Lord; how long? And be Thou entreated concerning Thy servants.  We were filled in the morning with Thy mercy, O Lord, and we rejoiced and were glad.  In all our days, let us be glad for the days wherein Thou didst humble us, for the years wherein we saw evils.  And look upon Thy servants, and upon Thy works, and do Thou guide their sons.  And let the brightness of the Lord our God be upon us, and the works of our hands do Thou guide aright upon us, yea, the works of our hands do Thou guide aright.</p> <center><b>Psalm 100</b></center> <p>Of mercy and judgment will I sing to Thee, O Lord; I will chant and have understanding in a blameless path. When wilt Thou come unto me?  I have walked in the innocence of my heart in the midst of my house.  I have no unlawful thing before mine eyes; the workers of transgressions I have hated.  A crooked heart hath not cleaved unto me; as for the wicked man who turned from me, I knew him not.  Him that privily talked against his neighbor did I drive away from me.  With him whose eye was proud and his heart insatiate, I did not eat.  Mine eyes were upon the faithful of the land, that they might sit with me; the man that walked in the blameless path, he ministered unto me.  The proud doer dwelt not in the midst of my house; the speaker of unjust things prospered not before mine eyes.  In the morning I slew all the sinners of the land, utterly to destroy out of the city of the Lord all them that work iniquity.</p>   </br> Glory to the Father and to the Son and to the Holy Spirit, both now and ever, and unto the ages of ages.
