<FASTING>
<!-- These are the general fasting rules.The fasting rules are coded as follows, using a seven bit number, that represents, from right to left: meat; diary products; fish; caviar; oil; wine; and dry food. A 1 would represent that a given category is permitted, while a 0 would represent that a given category is forbidden. The following are the 7 basic types of regulations in the Typikon, that should be recognised by the programmes specially:
0000000 : No Food/полное воздержание от пищи
0000001 : Strict Fast (Dry Food Only)/сухоядение [i.e. "xerophagy" -A.A]
0000011 : Food without oil/горячая пища без масла
0000111 : Food with oil/пища с растительным маслом/Fast: Wine and oil allowed
0001111 : Caviar is permitted/разрешается рыбная икра 
0011111 : Fish is permitted/разрешается рыба/Fast: Fish, wine, and oil allowed
0111111 : Meat is excluded/исключается мясо
1111111 : No fast/поста нет
0000010 : Wine Permitted
A NOTE ON dRank - I have modified dRank so that it corresponds with Type.
Yuri's dRanks			<-> 	Corresponds to Aleks's Types
4 : Polyeleos				4 : Polyeleos
3 : Vigil feasts		<->	5 : Vigil feasts
2 : Feast of the Theotokos	<->	6 : Great feasts
-A.A on 4/22/2009 N.S.
The last applicable fasting rule will be taken as the rule for the given day. Thus, there can be overlaps in the statement of the rules. The above rules may be parsed differently by a given programme depending on the desired uses of the given rules. The above rules represent the requirements for the full fledged monastic rules according to the Typicon.
