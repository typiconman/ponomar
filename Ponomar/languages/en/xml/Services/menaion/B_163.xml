The River Jordan receded of old by the mantle of Elisha when Elijah ascended into heaven; and
the water was separated to this side and that, the wet element turning into a dry path for Him,
being truly a symbol of Baptism, by which we cross the path of transient age. Christ appeared in
the Jordan to sanctify its waters.

Today hath the Lord appeared in the courses of the Jordan, crying to John and saying, Be not
dismayed at My Baptism; for I have verily come to save Adam, the first to be created.
