&lt;p&gt;      The holy martyrs Nazarius, Gervase, Protase, and Celsius suffered during the reign of the Emperor Nero in the city of Milan. The martyrs Nazarius and Celsius, who worked hard for the enlightenment of the pagans in the faith in Christ, were subjected to various tortures, were fed to beasts, thrown into the sea and, at last, when both survived, were beheaded. The martyrs Gervase and Protase were twins. St. Gervase for confessing Christ was whipped to death by tin rods, and St. Protase was truncated by the sword. Their relics were discovered in 357 and are now in Milan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy martyrs, O Lord, in their suffering received crowns of incorruption from Thee, our God; for having Thy might they deposed the tormentors and destroyed the powerless audacity of the dæmons. Through their prayers do Thou save our souls.&lt;/p&gt;
