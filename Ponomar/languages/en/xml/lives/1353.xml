&lt;p&gt;The Hieromartyr Methodios, Bishop of Patara (Lycian region in Asia Minor), was distinguished for his genuine monastic humility. Calmly and with mildness he instructed his flock, but together with this he firmly defended the purity of Orthodoxy and he energetically contended against heresies, especially the widespread heresy of the Origenists. He left behind him a rich literary legacy: works in defense of Christianity against paganism, explications of Orthodox dogmas against the heresy of Origen, moral discourses, and explanations of Holy Scripture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saint Methodios was arrested by the pagans, steadfastly confessed before them his faith in Christ, and in the year 312 he was sentenced to death by beheading. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thy blood mystically crieth out from the earth, like that of Abel, * O divinely wise and holy hierarch Methodius, * who manifestly preached that God became man. * Wherefore, thou hast put the deception of Origen to shame * and hast passed over to the heavenly bridal chamber. ** Entreat Christ God, that He save our souls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thou wast a priest of the mysteries of the Holy Trinity, * a proclaimer of the commandments of God which pass all understanding, * and the confirmation of the Orthodox, * O Methodius; * thou didst denounce the thoughts of the heretics for the sake of Orthodoxy, * shown by thy blood to be a hieromartyr. ** Standing before Christ with the angels, entreat Him that we be saved.&lt;/p&gt;
