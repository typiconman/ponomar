<SERVICE><LITURGY><TROPARION Tone="2" Type="1">The remembrance of the just is worthy of praise, but the Lord’s testimony is sufficient for you, O Forerunner; for it has shown that you are indeed more worthy of honour than the prophets. You were found worthy to baptize the Lord whom you foretold. Thereafter, you suffered for the truth and, rejoicing, also announced the good news to those in the Abyss that God had appeared as man, taking away the sins of the world, and granting to all of us the abundance of mercy. </TROPARION><KONTAKION Podoben="1" Tone="3" Type="1">Today the formerly barren woman gives birth to Christ’s Forerunner, who is the fulfillment of every prophecy; for in the Jordan, when he laid his hand on the One foretold by the prophets, he was revealed as Prophet, Herald, and Forerunner of God the Word.</KONTAKION></LITURGY></SERVICE></SAINT>
