        Ven. Theodore practiced asceticism as a monk in the Palestinian Monastery of St. Sabbas. During the reign of Emperor Leo the Armenian he arrived in Constantinople to defend Orthodoxy against the iconoclasts, and for his zealousness for iconolatry he suffered wounds and imprisonment. During the reign of Emperor Theophilus, St. Theodore again underwent torture for the holy icons. By order of Theophilus, he and his brother St. Theophanes (Oct. 11) were branded on their foreheads with a heated iron with the inscription of the accusation of their iconolatry. And the saintly brothers were banished to imprisonment in Apamea, Syria, where St. Theodore died (about the year 840). His relics subsequently were transferred to Chalcedon.
