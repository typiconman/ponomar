 The Monk Basil the Confessor, Bishop of Para, lived during the VIII Century. He was chosen to the bishop&apos;s chair by the inhabitants of Para, who venerated the saint as a true pastor of the flock of Christ. 	When the Iconoclast heresy broke out, Saint Basil resolutely came out on the side of icon veneration and refused to sign the directives for their abolition (the &quot;IniquitousScroll&quot; of the Council of 754 which had convened under the emperor Constantine V Copronymos (741-775). The saint shunned any contact with the heretics and did not permit them into his diocese. For his zeal he suffered much persecution, hunger and deprivation. 	To the very end of his life Saint Basil was faithful to the Orthodox confession.
