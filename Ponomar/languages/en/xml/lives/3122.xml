<KONTAKION Type="1" Tone="8">
 From thy youth, O wise one, thou didst manfully desire that which passeth understanding/ and didst forsake the tumult of the world./ For thy divine way of life thou becamest a dwelling-place of the Trinity,/ and hast illumined those who have recourse to thee with faith.// Wherefore, we cry out: Rejoice, O Paul who art most rich!
