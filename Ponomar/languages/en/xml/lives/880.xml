&lt;p&gt;The Monk John was born at the end of the VIII Century. At a young age he became a disciple of the Monk Gregory Dekapolites († c. 820, Comm. November 20) and accepted monastic tonsure from him at the Thessalonica (Soluneia) monastery. Under the guidance of this experienced teacher, the Monk John attained to high spiritual accomplishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the emperor Leo the Armenian (813-820) renewed the persecution against Orthodox Christians because of their veneration of holy icons, the Monk Gregory Decapolites together with the Monk Joseph the Writer of Church-Song († c. 863, Comm. April 4) and his student the Monk John set off from Thessalonica to Constantinople, to muster opposition to the Iconoclast heresy. In spite of persecution, for several years Saints Gregory and John fearlessly defended Orthodoxy, and preached veneration of holy icons. After many hardships the Monk Gregory died (in about the year 820), and soon after him his faithful student John also expired to the Lord. The Monk Joseph the Song-Writer transferred the relics of Saints Gregory and John and placed them in a church of Saint Nicholas the Wonderworker.&lt;/p&gt;</LIFE>

Adorning thy life with abstinence, O father,/ thou didst mortify thy flesh;/ wherefore, thou didst vanquish the attacks of the enemy, O all-blessed John,/ and hast passed over to God,/ to life everlasting free from sorrow, as a worthy heir.// Pray thou to Him, that we be saved.
