The Transfer of the Relics of the Holy Martyrs, Unmercenaries and Wonderworkers, Cyrus and John from the city of Konopa, near Alexandria (where they suffered in the year 311) to the nearby village of Manuphin, was done in the year 412. This Egyptian village prompted fear in everyone, since in a former time there was here a pagan temple and residence of evil spirits. Patriarch Theophilos (385-412) wanted to cleanse this place of demons, but he died. His wish was fulfilled by his successor upon the Alexandrian cathedra-chair, holy Patriarch Cyril (412-444). He prayed fervently in carrying out this project. An Angel of the Lord appeared in a vision to the sainted-hierarch and commanded the venerable relics of Saints Cyrus and John be transferred to Manuphin. His Holiness Patriarch Cyril did the Angel&apos;s bidding and built at Manuphin a church in the name of the holy martyrs. 	From that time this place was cleansed from the powers of the enemy, and by the prayers of the holy Martyrs Cyrus and John there began to occur many miracles, healings of the sick and infirm. An account about the holy Martyrs Cyrus and John is located under 31 January.

O Christ God, Thou hast given us an impregnable rampart/ in the miracles of Thy holy martyrs./ Through their supplications destroy Thou the councils of the heathen/ and strengthen the scepters of kingdoms,// in that Thou alone art good and lovest mankind.

Receiving the gift of miracles from grace divine, O saints,/ ye work wonders unceasingly,/ cutting down all our passions with invisible skill,/ O divinely wise Cyrus and glorious John:// for ye are divine physicians.
