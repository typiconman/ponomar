 Saint Mark Eugenikes, ArchBishop of Ephesus, was a reknown defender of Orthodoxy at the Council of Florence. Nothing was able to sway him towards Uniatism. Secretly slipping away from Florence, Saint Mark zealously urged the inhabitants of Constantinople to repudiate the dishonourable concordat. He died in the year 1457.
