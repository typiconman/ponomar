&lt;p&gt;The Monk Memnon the Wonderworker from the time of his youth asceticised in the Egyptian wilderness. By his arduous ascetic efforts he attained a victory of spirit over the flesh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having become abbot (hegumen) of one of the Egyptian monasteries, he wisely and carefully guided the brethren. And even while aiding them through prayer and counsel, the saint did not waver in his efforts in the struggle with temptation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through unceasing prayer and toil he received the gift of perspicacity: through his prayer a spring of water gushed forth in the wilderness; locusts destroying the harvest perished; those suffering shipwreck and calling on his name were saved. After his death the mere mention of his name dispelled a plague of locusts and undid the cunning wiles of evil spirits.&lt;/p&gt;
