With the apostles thy sound hath gone forth into all the earth;/ with the confessors thou didst endure sufferings for Christ;/ thou didst resemble the holy hierarchs in thy preaching of the Word;/ and with the venerable hast thou shone forth in the grace of God./ Therefore, the Lord hath exalted the depths of thy humility above the heavens,/ and hath given us thy name as a source of most wondrous miracles./ Wherefore, O wonderworker, who livest in Christ forever,/ take pity in thy love upon people in misfortunes;/ and hearken unto thy children,/ who with faith call upon thee,// O righteous John, our beloved pastor.

O father John, namesake of grace, who wast chosen by God from childhood, who in thy youth miraculously received from Him the gift of learning, and in a dream wast most gloriously called to be a priest: Entreat Christ God, that we may all be with thee in the kingdom of heaven.
