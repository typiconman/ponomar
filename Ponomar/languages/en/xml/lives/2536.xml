The Venerable Philip at 12 years of age was tonsured in the Monastery of the Venerable Cornelius of Komel. After living 15 years in the Cornelius Monastery the Venerable Philip, seeking silence, left it and founded a Monastery about 52 versts (34 miles) from Cherepovets, between the Great and Small Irap Rivers (see the Novgorod Diocese). He died in 1527. His relics repose in his Monastery in a hidden place.        The Nativity Lent begins after November 14. It anticipates the Feast of the Nativity itself for 40 days and is why it is referred to also as the forty days (see the Typicon (Ustav) Nov. 14). It is also called the St. Philip Lent, or in popular speech, St. Philip's (Filipovkami) because it begins after November 14, which is the day in memory of the Apostle Phillip. This fast is established by the Church for the worthy preparation of believers for the meeting of the very feast. According to the rules of abstinence it comes closer to Apostle's Lent (see May 17). Its severity is especially increased from December 20, the days of the Forefeast before the Nativity, and reaches its maximum degree in the so-called "eve (socheljnik)". This fast undoubtedly has an ancient origin, although clear mention of it is met only in the IV century. In the V century Leo the Great, mentioning this fast, indicates its ancient establishment and attributes to it the meaning of the offering of gathered fruit. The amount of days of this Lent in antiquity in different churches was not uniform. The uniform order in this respect was established in 1166 in the Constantinople Council that, on the basis of ancient typicons, defined the Nativity Lent of 40 days from November 14.
